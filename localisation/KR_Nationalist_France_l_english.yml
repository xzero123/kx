NFA_troops_on_the_streets:0 "Pétain Holds On"
NFA_troops_on_the_streets_desc:0 "With the political crisis reaching breaking point, and the junta embittered against civilian politics, Maréchal Pétain has given into the pressure, and taken the fateful decision to forcibly occupy the Assembly. The last sembalances of democratic rule are being swept away, with the Junta now focused on re-organising and militarising the state and society, while a rump parliament rubber-stamps its laws in the presence of armed soldiers."
NFA_demand_the_assemblys_loyalty:0 "Ensure the Assembly's Loyalty"
NFA_demand_the_assemblys_loyalty_desc:0 "Civilian politicians can be allowed to undermine national unity and our preparations for the liberation no longer. It is time to put a stop to their disloyalty and petty bickering. As such, we must ensure that the civilian politicians of the nation understand their secondary and advisory role to the President, and decide what to do with their parties."
NFA_a_new_premier:0 "A New Premier"
NFA_a_new_premier_desc:0 "Since his self-coup, Pétain has ruled alone as both President and Prime Minister. However, the old marshal has never enjoyed day-to-day administration, and nor does he have the time to engage in such matters while pre-occupied as both Head of State and a senior general. As such, he has resolved to delegate his position to a loyal member of his clique in the army, and leave ordinary matters of state to them, allowing for a more capable and efficient government."
NFA_a_new_constitution:0 "Replace the Constitution"
NFA_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "Although our consolidation of power over the last months has been vital for France to be saved, it has hardly been legal. In order to legitimise the continued dictatorship, and further free ourselves from divisive civilian politics, we must draft a new constitution for the French State, in order to streamline the Maréchal's leadership and prerogatives, and strenghten the nation's unity around him."
NFA_expand_the_deuxieme_beureau:0 "Expand the Deuxieme Beureau"
NFA_expand_the_deuxieme_beureau_desc:0 "Pétain has long had a close relationship with the intelligence agency of the nation, the Deuxieme Beureau. With the hour of the liberation now fast approaching, it is essential that we further invest in the service, in order to gain vital intelligence on the communard traitors. Meanwhile, we can also put some agents to work rooting out sedition at home, and ensuring that Algeria is freed of socialist infuence along with France proper."
NFA_memories_of_verdun:0 "Memories of Verdun"
NFA_memories_of_verdun_desc:0 "It was the Battle of Verdun in 1916, when he heroically held off the German swine, that truly made Pétain's career. and endeared him to the people. Now, with more great battles, this time to free France itself, on the horizon, we must revive the memories of the heroism of the Great War: not least the heroism of Pétain himself, whose populairty will doubtless recieve a significant boost from our campaigns."
NFA_seek_clergy_support:0 "Seek Support from the Clergy"
NFA_seek_clergy_support_desc:0 "The secularism of the republic has long alienated the Catholic church, with good Catholic men and women often drawn to needlessly radical movements in response. However, now that much of the republic has been swept away, and with many right-wing Catholics supportive of Pétain's strong and assertive leadership, we have a golden opportunity to mend our relations with the Church. By meeting with prominent clergymen and displaying Pétain's own faith, we shall truly endear ourselves to the God-fearing common man."
NFA_morality_and_service:0 "Morality and Service"
NFA_morality_and_service_desc:0 "With the clergy and army behind us, we can deepen our rhetoric of social conservatism and militarism, emphasising that traditional values go hand in hand with patriotism and self-sacrifice. By reiviving the memory of French heroes of ages past, and encouraging patriotic sermons from the clergy, we can show to the people that it is their Christian duty to their part to free France."
NFA_chantiers_de_jeunesse:0 "Chantiers de la Jeunesse"
NFA_chantiers_de_jeunesse_desc:0 "In order to bolster our support and position, and promote patriotism and family values, a new initiative has been proposed: camps at which young men will stay for a period of time where they will be taught to love God, to value hard work, and to love nature, besides absorbing a great deal of patriotism and respect for the Maréchal in the process."
NFA_cult_of_the_marechal:0 "The Cult of the Maréchal"
NFA_cult_of_the_marechal_desc:0 "Over the past months, our propaganda iniatives and traditionalist policies have caused Pétain's personal popularity to skyrocket. Reminded of his heroism at Verdun, and shown that he is a good Catholic dedicated to France, the people have increasingly come to support the old marshal, knowing him to be a responsible and determined man, under whose leadership France will prosper. It would be wise to encourage this immense popularity, and capitalise on it to further entrench our government."
NFA_la_revolution_nationale:0 "La Révolution Nationale"
NFA_la_revolution_nationale_desc:0 "With the abolishment of many republican institutions, the end of pretences of democracy, and our return to traditional values, a great change has come over French society. Maréchal Pétain has embraced this, proclaiming it the 'National Revolution': the true French spirit has forcefully asserted itself once more, and all who oppose it, be they republican demagogues or socialist traitors, will be swept away."
NFA_our_sole_purpose:0 "Our Sole Purpose"
NFA_our_sole_purpose_desc:0 "With the army now well and truly in charge of France, we are at last free to focus on the one great purpose for which the Military Government exists: the liberation of France. Whether or not we believe dictatorship to be right in the long term, we must embrace strong leadership so long as we are in exile, for only that can free us from the communard scum. Without the vested powers of the republic, we can now vastly expand our military investments."
NFA_militarise_society:0 "Militarise Society"
NFA_militarise_society_desc:0 "If France is to be liberated, the whole population must be dedicated to the great task before us. It will be no easy feat, but it must be done if we are once more to be among our fellow Frenchmen in liberty and under God. As such, we must promote militaristic culture and patriotism among the people, to ready the nation for the great war that looms ahead, and to legitimise our rule."
NFA_everything_for_the_liberation:0 "Everything for the Liberation"
NFA_everything_for_the_liberation_desc:0 "The great effort to free France will require the total commitment, total dedication, of every single patriot. Nobody can be found slacking, and all must do their duty for the patrie. Only through the shared determination of the whole nation can we hope to see the beauty of Paris once again. As such, we must use our propaganda to emphasise the need for total dedication, and greatly tighten conscription."
NFA_work_with_loyal_businesses:0 "Work with Loyal Businesses"
NFA_work_with_loyal_businesses_desc:0 "Pétain's regime has always enjoyed good relations with the world of business, and with our consolidation of power we can further capitalise on this. By granting favourable deals to businessmen who can prove their loyalty, and encouraging ideas of patriotism and class co-operation among business leaders, we can use our ties to the free market to greatly strengthen our hand."
NFA_arms_subsidies:0 "Arms Subsidies"
NFA_arms_subsidies_desc:0 "If there's one thing we need more than anything to free France, it's the arms and ammunition to wage war against an enemy that outnumbers us by many scores. As such, it is simply essential that we encourage business leaders to invest in armament production, by heavily subsidising the industry and offering less... official favourable treatment to those who can supply it."
NFA_la_france_enivree:0 "La France Enivrée"
NFA_la_france_enivree_desc:0 "There is one thing we must never forget, and that is that France is still held prisoner under Communard tyranny. Every day, good Catholics and valiant patriots suffer under the boot of Godless socialist scum, forced to live under a warmongering and degenerate regime. Not until our countrymen no longer have to suffer such a vile assault on their rights and faith can we resume the 'noramlity' of which our opponents love to speak."
NFA_unity_in_struggle:0 "Unity in Struggle"
NFA_unity_in_struggle_desc:0 "The task that lies before us, the task of setting the métropole free from the socialist filth, will be far from easy. We can expect no small amount of pain, loss, and bloodshed. But if there is one good thing that we can expect, it is unity and brotherhood among the people. All will share in the fight to free France, all will share in our triumphs and tragedies. And finally, after all the hardship and struggle, all will share in the freedom and peace that it is our mission to restore to the French people."
NFA_the_lion_roars:0 "The Lion Roars"
NFA_the_lion_roars_desc:0 "With our consolidation of power complete, and our preparations to reclaim the métropole well underway, the roar of the Lion of Verdun now resounds from Algiers, across Europe and Africa alike. The socialist filth must know that we are more than ready to crush them, and send them to hell where they belong, and they must know that the fateful day when we shall do so is drawing ever closer! Vive le Maréchal!"
NFA_la_restauration:0 "La Restauration"
NFA_la_restauration_desc:0 "With the AF's position in the government secure, we can make good on our promises to restore the Duc de Guise, Jean d'Orléans, to the French throne. With his influence rapidly giving way to the AF, on whom he is becoming reliant for continued support, Pétain shall have to oversee the transition from republic to monarchy, as his junta withers away."
NFA_emphasise_maurrasisme:0 "Emphasise Maurrasisme"
NFA_emphasise_maurrasisme_desc:0 "With the new AF government in place, Charles Maurras can at last seek to implement his integral nationalist ideals. Rooted in the rational need for order and hierarchy to guide society, Maurrasian ideology is the only tangible solution to France's countless problems. By siezing the initiative and forcing through sweeping legislation, and promoting his political literature, Maurras can at last show the whole nation the light of his ideology."
NFA_anti_parliamentarisme:0 "Anti-Parliamentarisme"
NFA_anti_parliamentarisme_desc:0 "There can be no doubt as to what doomed the French nation in the Weltkrieg and subsequent revolution. It was the weakness and bickering of republican politicians, and the division between Frenchmen caused by multi-party democracy, which led to our fall. Such a pathetic political situation can continue no longer, and the error of Pétain's tolerance the Assembly can finally be corrected. Having amassed the political capital to at last do so, the Maurras cabinet will put the Assembly in its place for good."
NFA_empower_the_camelots:0 "Empower the Camelots"
NFA_empower_the_camelots_desc:0 "The AF's paramilitary and youth group, the Camelots du Roi, has long been an invaluable asset of the party, dominating street fights against many unsavoury elements and teaching Maurrasian values to the French youth. Now that we have taken power, we can empower the Camelots within the government, granting them extensive powers and settling on a clearer purpose for the organisation."
NFA_classical_inspiration:0 "Classical Inspiration"
NFA_classical_inspiration_desc:0 "France is, fundamentally, a Latin and Mediterranean nation, and the roots of French civilisation are the Greek colonies on the southern coast of France and the Roman territories of Gaul. As such, the ideals and philosophy of the classical world must be the basis for French politics, and appreciation of the classics must be popularised in French culture. Long a proponent of classicism, Maurras intends to further popularise these ideals."
NFA_break_the_four_estates:0 "Break the Four Estates"
NFA_break_the_four_estates_desc:0 "Maurras has long identified the fundamental enemies of our civilisation, the anti-France, as being formed of "four confederate estates", namely Protestants, Jews, Freemasons, and immigrants, or, to use the ancient Athenian term, Metics. These four subversive elements have undermined France for centuries, spreading any number of insidious ideologies and enslaving the common Frenchman. It is time to finally break up their influence, if we are to ever have a chance of liberating France."
NFA_localist_ideals:0 "Localist Ideals"
NFA_localist_ideals_desc:0 "Vital to the Maurrasian ideology is an emphasis on localism and regional liberties. Although the circumstances of our exile makes it impossible for us to put this into practice, the government has resolved to form regional commitees of supportive exiles, ready to assume the reigns of local administration when the time comes, and to lay the legislative groundwork for the decentrlisation of the State, which can be put into practice after the Liberation."
NFA_smash_global_finance:0 "Smash Global Finance"
NFA_smash_global_finance_desc:0 "If France is to be truly independent, it must free itself from the shackles of global finance, with all its corruption, subversion, and Jewish influence. Even today, the bankers at the top are growing fat while decent Frenchmen toil in poverty. This can go on no longer, and it is time for the state to step in and break up corrupt foreign and Jewish businesses."
NFA_sacred_traditions:0 "The Necessity of Hierarchy"
NFA_sacred_traditions_desc:0 "In truth, modern ideals of democracy and liberalism amount to little more than a tyranny of finance and of mob rule, while socialist and most radical right-wing states are even less subtle in their tyranny. The only state that can grant the people genuine freedom is a traditionalist one, built on a natural hierarchy with the King at the top, using necessary authority to guide the people without devolving into a petty tyranny. It is such a state that we must build in France."
NFA_work_with_abbas:0 "Work with Abbas"
NFA_work_with_abbas_desc:0 "For some years now, the AF has enjoyed the support and assistance of the Action Algerienne, an Algerian Arab party inspired by our own movement and ideology. Its leader, Ferhat Abbas, is a staunch admirer of Maurras, and is glad to accpet an autonomous Algeria within the Kingdom of France. It is thus obvious that we should reach out to him and his party, integrating them into the government, to win favour among the Algerian population."
NFA_cultural_revivals_among_exiles:0 "French Traditions"
NFA_cultural_revivals_among_exiles_desc:0 "The many local cultures and traditions of France, from Brittany to Provence and Corsica to Normandy, are each beautiful and unique, and it is the duty of any truly French government to do its utmost to preserve each one. These traditions are under attack each day from the Communard tyrants, and it is down to us to liberate every distinct part of France from their grip. Promoting revivals of local culture among the exiles, and organising them based on their region of origin, will galvanise support for the liberation."
NFA_royal_corporatism:0 "Royal Corporatism"
NFA_royal_corporatism_desc:0 "The unrestrained capitalism of today is destructive to regional liberty and to traditional values, and it is vital that we take a stance against it. However, socialism is an equally nagative system, and we must seek an alternative, reorganising the economy into state-controlled corporations. With the economy under state supervision, we will be able to proactively ready it for the liberation, and break what remains of foreign influence."
NFA_end_romanticism:0 "End Romanticism"
NFA_end_romanticism_desc:0 "One of the greatest evils of the 19th century was the growth of romanticism in art and literature. A deviant movement, an affront to tradition and to the high standards of the Classics, the spread of romanticism went hand in hand with that of liberalism, and we cannot truly free ourselves from one without freeing ourselves from the other. As such, the government must take action to promote true and time-honoured forms of art, infinitely superior to the degenerate movement of the last century."
NFA_support_native_elites:0 "Support Native Elites"
NFA_support_native_elites_desc:0 "The aid of local native rulers has always sustained French colonial rule in Africa. Now, however, this support gives us a perfect opportunity to put Maurras's localist principles into practice. By granting native rulers greater autonomy and self-rule, conditional of course on loyalty to France and contributions to the Liberation, we can perfect the practical means of decentralising the state, and strengthen native acceptance of colonial rule."
NFA_order_and_reason:0 "Order and Reason"
NFA_order_and_reason_desc:0 "Above all else, the state must maintain order and decency in society, and doing so necessitates the use of force. Force, however, is worthless and tyrannical without a higher reason and a higher purpose to guide it. In the integral nationalist doctrine of Maurras, we have that purpose, and in the Camelots du Roi and military we have the force. The Kingdom must be accepted by all good Frenchmen, and in exchange all good Frenchmen will enjoy rational and orderly governance."
NFA_mend_relations_with_the_holy_see:0 "Mend Relations with the Holy See"
NFA_mend_relations_with_the_holy_see_desc:0 "The last great barrier to Maurras's rule is the AF's estrangement from the Papacy and Holy See. Although the Church should be one of our greatest allies, and would normally be supportive of a traditionalist and counter-revolutionary monarchy, they have long been alienated by Maurras's own agnosticism, and his view of the Church as little more than a politically convenient force, as opposed to the Ministry of Christ. We must take measures to end this rift."
NFA_ancient_liberties:0 "Liberty Through Authority"
NFA_ancient_liberties_desc:0 "Although the creation of an authoritarian state is used all too frequently by tyrants, authority can exist perfectly well without tyranny, and indeed is needed to avoid tyranny. Only through the authoritarianism of the state can we keep at bay global finance, the Four Estates, socialism, and every other evil waiting to oppress the French people. Our authority alone is what guarantees genuine liberty."
NFA_the_kingdom_from_the_ashes:0 "The Kingdom Reborn"
NFA_the_kingdom_from_the_ashes_desc:0 "At last, after every trial and tribulation, the great Kingdom of France stands proud once again, confident in the justice of its system and the rightness of its purpose. United under His Majesty and Maurras's cabinet, with the military's loyalty assured, we stand ready to liberate our French brothers and sisters in the Commune, and to restore French greatness to the world. Vive la France, et vive le Roi!"
NFA_celebrate_joan_of_arc:0 "Celebrate Jeanne d'Arc"
NFA_celebrate_joan_of_arc_desc:0 "The symbol of the republic, Marianne, encaspulates everything wrong with that decrepit State. Depicted in filthy clothes and barely dressed, Marianne represents perfectly the poverty and decadence of Republican France. A preferable alternative to such a filthy idol is Jeanne d'Arc, French hero of the 100 Years' War and a revered saint. By popularising her heroics, we can promote the AF's values further."
NFA_the_colonel_at_the_helm:0 "De la Rocque at the Helm"
NFA_the_colonel_at_the_helm_desc:0 "In order to restore support for his presidency and for the military, Philippe Pétain has appointed Colonel François de la Rocque, leader of the Croix-de-Feu, as his new Premier. As de la Rocque, despite his military past, is the first civilian premier since 1919, this marks a major step, and according to some, the beginning of the end of the junta. Either way, de la Rocque now his a free hand to implement his Catholic and corporatist policies across the nation."
NFA_defang_the_assembly:0 "Defang the Assembly"
NFA_defang_the_assembly_desc:0 "Parliamentary weakness and bickering has been a thorn in the side of the Republic for long enough. It was the division and chaos of parliamentary government that doomed us in the Great War and revolution, and it would be madness to suggest that Foch's coup in 1919 was anything but justified. As such, we must finally put a stop to the parliamentarism that divides us even today, concentrating power in the President, Premier, and cabinet."
NFA_military_alliances:0 "Military Co-Operation"
NFA_military_alliances_desc:0 "De la Rocque is the first civilian to be appointed Premier since the coup in 1919, and understandably many officers are concerned that their political influence will come to an end. It is crucial that we assauge these fears, by meeting with prominent generals and explaining our shared values and goals, offering them government posts and reassuring them of our good intentions."
NFA_support_patriotic_industrialists:0 "Align Patriotic Industrialists"
NFA_support_patriotic_industrialists_desc:0 "Rightwing businessmen, socially conscious and nationalistic, have long been crucial supporters of the Croix-de-Feu, their funds working magic for the party's continued success. We should reward these good men with government positions and contracts, and thus further incentivise other wealthy businessmen to join their ranks."
NFA_strike_hidden_socialism:0 "Strike at Hidden Socialism"
NFA_strike_hidden_socialism_desc:0 "For years now, de la Rocque has warned the nation of "hidden socialism", a nefarious enemy within. Now that we are in power, we can finally begin investigating and stamping out socialist and Communard infiltration. The Deuxieme Bureau, a longstanding bastion of anti-socialism, will be given extended powers to detect and fight socialism, investigating opposition politicians and others who remain sceptical of the government."
NFA_bolster_the_mass_movement:0 "Bolster the Mass Movement"
NFA_bolster_the_mass_movement_desc:0 "The Croix-de-Feu has come a long way from its origins as a veterans' association, and, since being reformed into a political party in 1933, has gained a mess membership unprecedented for French parties, with its own newspapers, security services, and youth groups. If de la Rocque's regime is to prosper, we must further emphasise the party's populist appeal, and incentivise membership as a requirement for government positions and contracts."
NFA_republique_sociale:0 "République Sociale"
NFA_republique_sociale_desc:0 "With the Croix-de-Feu stronger than ever, and having gained the support of much of the establishment, de la Rocque can finalyl reform the failed Third Republic into a new République Sociale Française, creating a new French constitution along Catholic and corporatist lines, with the support of the Assmebly and military. Under the Colonel's guidance, France shall prosper like never before."
NFA_a_minimum_wage:0 "A Minimum Wage"
NFA_a_minimum_wage_desc:0 "Despite our good relations with business, we must never forget or ignore the struggles and sacrifices made by ordinary French workers. The working class makes up a substantial proportion of our membership, and any government has a duty, albeit one long neglected by the Republican establishment, to provide for the common man. As such, we should establish a fair and just minimum wage for all French workers, something which our corporate allies can quite easily afford."
NFA_catholic_state_unions:0 "Catholic State Unions"
NFA_catholic_state_unions_desc:0 "The free-market capitalism of previous governments was a divisive and unsustainable system, and only left the working class with much justified resentment, which was taken advantage of by socialists and erupted in the Revolution. We must take care to never let such resentment build up again. As such, the state will assume control of the remaining trade unions, and reorganise them into Catholic organisations, which can represent workers on company boards and ensure just treatment, while also promoting faith and patriotism among their members."
NFA_restore_the_place_of_the_church:0 "Restore the Place of the Church"
NFA_restore_the_place_of_the_church_desc:0 "Ever since 1905, the Republic has had no organised ties with the Catholic Church, and Catholicism in France has come under attack from Republican elites. Although the conservative policies of Pétain's government did go some way to restoring morality, much work remains to be done, and it is de la Rocque, champion of the Catholic middle class, who will do it. It is time to reach out to the Holy See, and sign a new Concordat with the Church."
NFA_bridge_class_divide:0 "Bridge the Class Divide"
NFA_bridge_class_divide_desc:0 "Class divisions and inequality have crippled our nation for too long, leaving hard-working workers embittered against France and vulnerable to leftist subversion, while their elites grow rootless and complacent. The time for such a disasterous state of affairs is no more, and through worker representation on company boards and state oversight of the market, a new era of class collaboration can set in, in which every man knows and accepts his place and purpose."
NFA_expand_the_dispos:0 "Expand the Dispos"
NFA_expand_the_dispos_desc:0 "The dispos have served as paramilitary and security service for the Croix-de-Feu for years now, asserting the party's presence on the streets and protecting our members, without devolving into the same violence and illegality as the AF's Camelots and other organisations. To protect the government and secure our position, we should further promote membership of the dispos among young men, and empower them to act against our rivals."
NFA_le_flambeau:0 "Le Flambeau"
NFA_le_flambeau_desc:0 "Le Flambeau has always been the newspaper of the Croix-de-Feu, and is popular among our membership. However, propaganfa is of little use when read only by those who already support us. As such, we should invest more heavily in Le Flambeau, expanding its journalistic staff and increasing its circulation, to ensure our message reaches the whole population."
NFA_fils_et_filles:0 "Fils et Filles"
NFA_fils_et_filles_desc:0 "The Fils et Filles de Croix de Feu is the youth wing of our party, teaching the children of loyal members exercise, hard work, and faith. Our government will be greatly strengthened in the long term if we expand this organisation, and so we shall strongly encourage government officials, whatever their personal sympathies, to enroll their children in the movement, and greatly increase the organisation's funding."
NFA_votes_for_women:0 "Votes for Women"
NFA_votes_for_women_desc:0 "Female suffrage has long been championed by parties across the French right, with women held to be modest and conscientious enough to likely vote en masse for conservative parties. In order to strengthen the party's hand and further legitimise future electoral successes, we should extend the franchise to women, and meanwhile extend the Croix-de-Feu's own women's organisations, to galvanise support among the new voterbloc."
NFA_legalist_state:0 "Legalist State"
NFA_legalist_state_desc:0 "The duty of the state, above all else, is to maintain social order and the rule of law, keeping all its citizens safe and free. A state which cannot do this is a failed state, and we must not forget it. By further putting into law the emerging corporatist system, and expaning the police, we can maintain capable and orderly governance to prepare France for the liberation."
NFA_encourage_personality_cult:0 "Encourage the Cult of Personality"
NFA_encourage_personality_cult_desc:0 "Colonel de la Rocque's charisma and popularity has caused him to become deeply popular among his commited followers, with his portrait becoming a common sight in the homes and workplaces of Croix-de-Feu loyalists. To further consolidate our government and promote de la Rocque' public image, we should encourage this cult of personality, celebrating his heroism in the Great War and commitment to France."
NFA_entrench_corporatism:0 "Entrench Corporatism"
NFA_entrench_corporatism_desc:0 "With unions brought under state control and represented in government, and with the state brokering positive relations between employers and workers, a new corporate state has finally taken hold in France. We should further formalise this state of affairs with a new corporate charter, signed by business leaders and unionists and passed into law, to ensure that all co-operate for the common good under state supervision."
NFA_social_dabord:0 "Social d'Abord!"
NFA_social_dabord_desc:0 "With corporatism succesfully established, and the mass movement of the Croix-de-Feu stronger than ever, Colonel de la Rocque has succesfully transformed French politics. With the support of workers, the military, industrialists, and the Church assured, the new French state stands proud and united, ready to liberate the métropole and to bring justice to all Frenchmen."
NFA_victory_for_af:0 "La France Bouge"
NFA_victory_for_af_desc:0 "At long last, after all the decadence, chaos, and bickering of the hated Republic, Phillipe Pétain has reached out to Charles Maurras and the Action Française, and, in exchange for their support, has commited to finally restore the legitimate rulers of France, the House of Orléans, to the throne. With preparations for a restoration well underway, the whole nation can rejoice, for true and ancient governance is about to return."
NFA_compromise_with_the_liberals:0 "A Republican Cabinet"
NFA_compromise_with_the_liberals_desc:0 "With the inevitable corruption and waste of his junta having become undeniable public knowledge, Phillipe Pétain has caved to the pressure of his allies in the Assembly and of much of the business community, and appointed Louis Marin, leader of the Catholic and conservative but thoroughly republican FR, as his new Premier. Marin makes no secret of his intention to restore a civilian-led Republican government, but many believe that this will be an uphill struggle."
NFA_republican_govt:0 "Form a Unity Government"
NFA_republican_govt_desc:0 "For now, Marin is merely Premier of Pétain's "Provisional Military Goverment", and in spite of his goals of republicanisation, the junta is, for now, intact. Of course, this must change, and so Marin must now sit down with the other Republican parties, in spite of all their past differences, and attempt to form a new broad coalition government, capable of restoring Republican institutions and constitutional integrity in anticipation of the Liberation."
NFA_restore_assembly_power:0 "Strenghten the Assembly"
NFA_restore_assembly_power_desc:0 "Ever since 1919, National France has been little more than a Presidential dictatorship under Foch and Pétain. Now, however, we can begin to change this, and restore the legislature to its rightful place as the dominant branch of government. New legislation, made possibele by the Republican parties' renewed co-operation, will strenghten the hand of the Assembly, and restore checks and balances on executive power."
NFA_reassure_the_military:0 "Although we are working to break the military's grip on political power, we nevertheless need their support for the government to stay intact and for there to be any hope of a succesful liberation. As such, we have little choice but to reach out to the military command, and placate their fears about democratisation, while offering the concessions needed to bring them around to the government."
NFA_constitutional_security:0 "Constitutional Guarantees"
NFA_constitutional_security_desc:0 "Neither Pétain nor Foch ever formally suspended the Third Republic's constitution, but it is obvious that their junta has defied all of its democratic principles. It is thus vital to reinforce the checks on executive power and free speech enshrined in the consitution, and push through further legislation in support of the same ideals of liberty."
NFA_republican_traditions:0 "Republican Traditions"
NFA_republican_traditions_desc:0 "Since 1789, French republicanism has gained its own distinct aesthetic and philosophical identity, with many historic celebrations and civic rituals attached to the Republic. In order to restore faith in the parliamentary system, we must breathe new life into the Republican ideal, promoting the romantic art celebrating Republican history and rejuvenating its rituals and ceremonial duties of the Republic's leaders."
NFA_ceremonial_presidency:0 "A Ceremonial Presidency"
NFA_ceremonial_presidency_desc:0 "Ever since Foch seized power in 1919, the executive branch has had a tight grip on French politics, with the legislature and judiciary greatly sidelined. Now, however, with the unity government entrenched and Pétain having largely accepted the Assembly's control over ordinary governance, we can further reduce the role of the President to a ceremonial figurehead, a role for which the popular war hero Pétain is excellent, with his prestige sure to further bolster our support."
NFA_judicial_independence:0 "Judicial Independence"
NFA_judicial_independence_desc:0 "Under the junta, the legal system was frequently used to unjustly persecute the military's political enemies, and courts were frequently intimidated to make rulings favourable to the political circumstances of the regime. This is not healthy or sustainable for a democratic republic, and so we must further enshrine the independence of the judicial branch in law, and reinforce respect for the consitutional clauses intended to provide for it."
NFA_free_petain_prisoners:0 "Free the Junta's Prisoners"
NFA_free_petain_prisoners_desc:0 "Over the 17 years it was in power, the junta unjustly arrested many of its political opponents, in spite of their obvious anti-socialism, proven by the fact that they too chose to flee to Algeria. Staunch supporters of democracy, these men are excellent politicians and administrators in waiting for our government, and, having reinforced the independence of the judiciary, we should set about revoking their sentences."
NFA_legislative_empowerment:0 "Parliamentary Empowerment"
NFA_legislative_empowerment_desc:0 "With our economic reforms implemented and Pétain, albeit reluctantly, having accepted a largely ceremonial role aas a unifying figurehead for the government and nation, we can now go a step further, and consolidate power in the Assembly, exercised through the Premier and cabinet. The French Republic will be a parliamentary republic, or it will be no republic at all."
NFA_monetary_reform:0 "Devalue the Franc"
NFA_monetary_reform_desc:0 "Pétain's junta was all too frequently negligent of the economy, at least so long as it was keeping them suppplied with armaments. Of course, this is thoroughly unsustainable, and only a determined program of monetary and financial reform can create an economy capable of fuelling the liberation. There is much debate within the coalition about how to reform the economy, but all sides agree that the Franc must be devalued, and so we can start our reforms on this note."
NFA_reynaud_plan:0 "Plan Reynaud"
NFA_reynaud_plan_desc:0 "Premier Marin has accepted the economic proposals of Paul Reynaud of the Alliance Démocrate. A staunch believer in deregulation and the free market, Reynaud adovcates privatisation, cutting out red tape, and strengthening ties with big business as a vital step to get the economy into shape. We can begin to implement these proposals by returning to the free market the indsutries which Pétain's junta has attempted to manage or supervise."
NFA_end_fourty_hour_week:0 "End the Fourty-Hour Week"
NFA_end_fourty_hour_week_desc:0 "Excessive regulation and intervention in the market will only stifle the private talent and initiative that we need in order to liberate France, something which the business community has sought to warn of for years now. Some of the red tape that business is most opposed to is the legal maximum of fourty hours of work a week, a law that the AD has sought to repeal for some time. With the blessing of Marin and the FR, Reynaud and his allies can finally do away with this worthless legislation."
NFA_free_market:0 "Encourage Private Initiative"
NFA_free_market_desc:0 "It is the initiative and dynamism of the free market, not any amount of incompetent and heavy-handed state intervention, that will get our economy into a fit state for the liberation and enrich the nation. It is time for the state to further step back from economic intervention, ensuring big business's support for democratisation, and also taking more steps to promote values of entrepeneurship and hard work."
NFA_chautemps_plan:0 "Plan Chautemps"
NFA_chautemps_plan_desc:0 "Premier Marin has accepted the economic proposals of Camille Chautemps of the Parti Radical. Coming from a historically left-wing party, which at least formally still claims socialist credentials, Chautemps advocates for the representation of workers and for a welfare state, alongside increased state intervention. We can begin to implement these plans by greatly increasing government spending on social welfare, and widening the net for those who can recieve it."
NFA_nationalise_infrastructure:0 "Nationalise Infrastructure"
NFA_nationalise_infrastructure_desc:0 "We cannot allow the narrow interests of a few wealthy businessmen to obstruct the national interest at this vital time, when we absolutely need high-quality infrastructure to connect our sprawling colonies, in order to stimulate the mobilisation and war effort. As such, as per Chautemps's proposals, the state will assume control over ongoing infrastructure projects, and ownership of the roads and railways that currently link together the colonies."
NFA_worker_representation:0 "Worker Representation"
NFA_worker_representation_desc:0 "The revolution happened because the ordinary French worker was allowed to feel powerless, exploited, and betrayed. If we are to organise a succesful liberation campaign, let alone to regain the loyalty of ordinary Frenchmen, we must enshrine the representation of workers through trusted trade unions, whose representatives will take places on company boards. This will create a succesful spirit of collaboration between social classes, reducing class tensions and also reducing the support for right-wing corporatists."
NFA_economic_mobilisation:0 "Economic Mobilisation"
NFA_economic_mobilisation_desc:0 "The main part of our economic reforms have now been pushed through, and so we can turn our attention to the coming war, expanding on our financial intiatives to ready the economy for war. Increased subsidies for arms production and propaganda reminding businessmen of the current war and the need for patriotism will ensure that the business community is prepared for the coming conflict."
NFA_republican_restoration:0 "Republican Rejuvenation"
NFA_republican_restoration_desc:0 "With Pétain haven given up his old dictatorial powers and the parties of the Republic having deepened their spirit of co-operation, popular confidence in democracy and Republicanism is steadily returning, with Marin increasingly seen as a benevolent elder statesman and Pétain's own popularity also helping round up support support for the coalition. The ideals of the Third Republic truly have been rejuvenated, and Marin's government has succeeded in its mission to restore Parliamentarism."
NFA_relax_censorship:0 "Relax Censorship"
NFA_relax_censorship_desc:0 "Under the junta, the press was routinely muzzled in its political coverage and stances, and more often bought off to print favourable stories. Harsh censorhsip laws are still in place, supposedly on the pretext of the State of Emergency, and these are thoroughly incompatibale with our moves towards democratisation. It is time we repeal these measures, and restore freedom to the press and the ordinary man."
NFA_cleanse_corruption:0 "Clean Up Corruption"
NFA_cleanse_corruption_desc:0 "During the junta's grip on politics, many personal friends or family members of government officials got easy access to government posts or subsidies, and more often than not blatant and obviously criminal practicies such as bribery and extortion would be practiced by unscrupulous administrators. We must take measures to investigate and bring to justice these undesirable men, and send a clear message that only merit will bring success in the new government."
NFA_government_of_consensus:0 "A Government of Consensus"
NFA_government_of_consensus_desc:0 "After much time, we have finally succeeded in ending military rule, economic stagnation, and corruption in National France. In spite of their many evident deifferences, the Republican parties have embraced the spirit of consensus and co-operation, and Pétain's own popularity has done much to buoy our support. We have democratised as much as we can within the colonies, and stand ready to bring true liberty to our brothers across the Mediterranean. Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, pour toujours!"

Considering itself heir to the tradition of progressive republicanism rather than socialist class warfare, much of the party sided against the revolution and its parliamentarians joined the government in exile in Algiers.

Of the old major parties, they suffered the worst from the Defeat, the Civil War, and the Exile.

Following his death in 1929, his fellow Great War hero, Phillipe Pétain, steped in to fill his shoes, all but unopposed. Pétain, however, has taken a more conciliatory tone than Foch, and has been willing to work with and delegate to political parties and their leadersip. Nonetheless, this “Temporary Military Government” has now lasted for almost two decades, and almost evert Frenchman is by now embittered against it for any number of reasons. It won't take much for these grievances to come out, and the status quo won't be able to last forever...§!" 
NFA_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Croix de Feu\n§LFounded by nationalistic veterans, with extensive financial support from right-wing industrialists, the Croix de Feu, under the leadership of the war hero Colonel François de la Rocque, has rallied much of the republican right. Staunchly nationalistic, the party vehemently opposes unchecked parliamentary democracy, arguing that its weakness allowed the for fall of the Republic in 1919. Staunchly againt perecieved "hidden socialism" among the democratic left, and supportive of a new corporate state in France, the party has become one of Pétain’s most loyal allies in the assembly, although some are concerned that de la Rocque's own populism and cult of personality among his supporters can't exist alongside Pétain’s presidency forever." 
NFA_national_populist_party_long:0 "Action Française\n§LFounded in 1899 amidst the political chaos and anti-semitic nationalist upheaval of the Dreyfus affair, the Action Française is the origin of integral-nationalist thought, and the champion of Orléans monarchism in modern France. Led from an early stage by the royalist intellectual Charles Maurras, the party seeks to restore an idealised vision of France as it was before the revolutions and rapid changes of the 18th and 19th centuries. The AF upholds principles of localism and state Catholicism, but Maurras's own agnosticism and largely cynical idea of the Church as a unifying and federating force, rather than the true ministry of Christ, has nonetheless caused friction with the clergy. In spite of this, the AF has always been a bulwark of middle class traditionalism, a position greatly strenghtened by the bitterness and resentment against the republican order that has developed since the revolution and exile.§!" 
NFA_national_populist_party_darnand_long:0 "Chevaliers du Glaive\n§LA formerly fringe movement on the French radical right, Joseph Darnand's splinter group from the Croix-de-Feu has now risen to power with the reluctant consent of the junta, amidst an increasingly chaotic political crisis. Inspired by the Romanian legionaires, among other extreme right movements, Darnand's movement defines itself against liberal democracy, capitalism, socialism, and the "Jewish leper", instead embracing a vision of discipline, hierarchy, fanatic nationalism, and "true liberty", under a single unchallenged leader, namely Joseph Darnand himself. The government claims to be deeply Catholic, and to represent "Christian civilisation”, but its often checked violence and radicalism will inevitbaly set it apart from the Church. Linked with many other ultranationalist movements, notably the terroristic secret order of La Cagoule, the Chevaliers are sure to never hesitate to use brutal force and determination in their concolidation of power in France.§!"

As such, the Junta has now devoted itself to reorganising and militarising French society and politics with one goal in mind: the dream that one day, the tricolour might flutter over Paris again, and that the Maréchal might finally find peace in the soil of Verdun.§!"

POLITICS_LOUIS_BONAPARTE_DESC:0 "Born in 1914, Louis Bonaparte is a young man who has known exile his whole life. Indeed Louis is since 1926 the head of the Bonaparte family, exiled along with all other former reigning families by French law passed in 1886. Born in Belgium, his family fled to England shortly after his birth, before fleeing further to Switzerland after the British revolution. This allowed him to join the French army, where he quickly rose through the ranks during the war thanks to his heroic deeds, followed by our people with bated breath. Close to PSF, with whom he shares a conception of democratic rule with a strong head, he has surprisingly been elected president by a parliament newly dominated by the Bloc National, creating worry among committed Republicans. Louis Bonaparte has however assured that he would not repeat the modus operandi of his ancestors, praising the Republic for having managed to survive exile and war.\n\nHowever, once a dead movement, monarchical Bonapartism is seeing a rise in popular support, as young Louis enjoys ever-growing popularity. Only time will tell whether or not the Prince will attempt to seize the crown..."
POLITICS_NAPOLEON_VI_DESC:0 "Born in 1914, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte is a young man who has known exile his whole life. Indeed Louis is since 1926 the head of the Bonaparte family, exiled along with all other former reigning families by French law passed in 1886. Born in Belgium, his family fled to England shortly after his birth, before fleeing further to Switzerland after the British revolution. This allowed him to join the French army, where he quickly rose through the ranks during the war thanks to his heroic deeds, followed by our people with bated breath. Close to PSF, with whom he shares a conception of democratic rule with a strong head, he was surprisingly elected president by a parliament newly dominated by the Bloc National, creating worry among committed Republicans. Though he had assured them of his commitment to the Republic, the support for the restoration of House Bonaparte on the throne of France quickly grew.\n\nAfter his victory against the German Empire and the reconquest of all rightfully French land, his popularity further skyrocketed, and restoration was a simple formality: a single plebiscite and the Empire was reborn. Committed Republicans were appalled, but the French people rejoiced, as they always knew that the Bonapartes were always destined to lead France to glory."
POLITICS_FRANCOIS_DE_LA_ROCQUE_DESC:0 "Born in 1885, François de La Rocque, commonly referred to as simply “the Colonel”, has accomplished a brilliant military and political career. An alumnus of Saint-Cyr, he was grievously wounded during the Great War, was mentioned in dispatches nine times and became at thirty-three one of the youngest commanding officers in the French armed forces, receiving the Légion d'Honneur for military valour in 1916. A patriot and pious Catholic, he remained loyal to the government as the revolution broke out. After the exile he joined the Croix-de-Feu, a veterans group that quickly attracted tens of thousands of veterans who hoped to revive the spirit of comradeship of the trenches and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming its president in 1931. A supporter of Henri Mordacq, like him he supports democracy and the Republic, though he prefers a strong rule, scarred by the infamous parliamentary instability of the Third Republic. Having founded the Parti Social Français in the early 1930s, the party quickly grew exponentially, becoming the first mass party in French politics, all devoted to the Colonel and his hope of a reformed Republic.\n\nChosen to head the democratic coalition after the end of Marshal Pétain’s junta, he has served France since implementing much of his ideas. However, with the mainland reconquered, the Colonel saw in his former democratic allies the seeds of instability that would once again lead France to her fall, as Communard remnants still lurk and hope for any opportunity to strike. As such, he has formed a new government with military figures, to temporarily head France until full democracy can be safely restored."
POLITICS_LOUIS_MARIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1871, Louis Marin is a veteran of parliamentary politics, having first been elected as a deputy of his native Moselle in 1905, being a founding member of the Fédération Republicaine that he headed until its fusion with the Alliance Démocratique, he has been a part of the Chamber of Deputies for now close to four decades. An ethnography professor, conservative, cultured, patriotic, a moderate Catholic, Marin is the very picture of a distinguished older gentleman, well appreciated by his colleagues and the public at large. An ardent defender of the primacy of parliament, he nonetheless did little to oppose Marshal Pétain’s bid to power, though he still often privately agitated for a restoration of democracy.\n\nFollowing the fall of Marshal Pétain’s regime, he was of course among those chosen to be a part of the Government of National Unity, a new Union Sacrée. With the victory of the right in the latest legislative elections, he has been elected president, almost as if it was the natural conclusion of his illustrious career. Preferring a largely ceremonial role, he nonetheless hopes to revive the spirit of the early Third Republic and head a conservative, moderate, patriotic regime."
POLITICS_EDOUARD_DALADIER_DESC:0 "Born in 1884, son of a baker, a teacher then mayor of his hometown of Carpentras, Édouard Daladier is a pure product of Republican meritocracy. After years on the Western Front, where he bravely served and received citations and the Légion d’Honneur, he remained loyal to the government after the revolution broke out. In exile, a  man of the moderate left, he was seen with suspicion despite his opposition to revolutionary socialism, especially as he quickly rose through the ranks of the Parti Radical, so recently divided as its left-wing joined the socialists in revolt. He fiercely defended the primacy of parliament against Marshal Pétain’s creeping encroachment, which earned him the praise of the few remaining committed democrats and the nickname “the Bull of Vaucluse” for his pugnacity.\n\nFollowing the fall of Marshal Pétain’s regime, he was of course among those called to serve as part of the Government of National Unity, the new Union Sacrée. With the victory of the reunited Radical Party during the latest legislative elections, he was chosen by his peers as president. Preferring a largely ceremonial role, in the tradition of the Third Republic, he hopes to lead a renewed Republic, parliamentary, secular, and liberal."
POLITICS_PAUL_REYNAUD_DESC:0 "Born in 1878, a lawyer by trade, Paul Reynaud was young enough to be mobilised in 1914 and fight in every major engagement of the Great War, even being dispatched to Russia to assist the White forces in 1918. After the defeat, a man of the moderate right, thoroughly committed to economic liberalism, he joined the ranks of the Alliance Démocratique, revealing himself to be a captivating orator and fierce political animal in the chaos of exile. When Marshal Pétain and his supporters formed an emergency government, he begrudgingly accepted the new status quo, but never wavered in his commitment to his ideals of liberal, democratic Republic. When the AD fused with the Fédération Républicaine to create the Parti Républicain Démocrate, he quickly further rose to prominence in this consolidated liberal right-wing, one of the few voices in parliament to even attempt to push back on some of the Marshal’s initiatives.\n\nWith democracy restored, Reynaud is hard at work to restore the spirit of the Republic, deeply damaged by the defeat and the junta. Preferring a more active role as president, he hopes to implement his unorthodox economic ideas, shying away from free-market economics in favour of light dirigisme, making him a somewhat more amenable to the PSF."
POLITICS_CAMILLE_CHAUTEMPS_DESC:0 "Born in 1885, Camille Chautemps could be described as the prototypical Radical. Born into a bourgeois family of Radical politicians, a lawyer by trade, a prominent Freemason, committed to economic and political liberalism as well parliamentary supremacy, he quickly rose through the ranks of the Parti Radical following the exile, appreciated for his fierce denunciations of the breakaway left-wing of the party, and willingness to compromise with his opponents. He was among those who actively defended a return to normal democratic life following the bid of Marshal Pétain for power but quickly found himself somewhat isolated. Indeed, his Freemason links worked against him, as he was given the nickname of “Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret” by right-wing newspapers, accused of working in concert with the left-wing of the Radical party still active in the Commune.\n\nFollowing the fall of Marshal Pétain, though he was not called to serve as part of the Government of National Unity, he remained active in the party. With the victory of the reunited Radical Party during the latest legislative elections, he was chosen by his peers as president. Preferring a largely ceremonial role, in the tradition of the Third Republic, he hopes to lead a renewed Republic, parliamentary, secular, and liberal."
POLITICS_PIERRE_FLANDIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1889, Pierre-Étienne Flandin is a lawyer by trade, but as the son of a politician, he was naturally predisposed to following in his footsteps. Elected to parliament at only 25, his burgeoning career was cut short by the Great War during which he served with distinction as a balloon observer. There was born his speciality: advocacy for aeronautical development, and precise technical knowledge. Indeed, Flandin is not a charismatic man: an admirer of British institutions and liberalism, this admiration can be felt in the character of the man, detached, phlegmatic, in stark contrast with the passionate politics of the Chamber of Deputies and so very British. A man of the moderate right, he joined the Alliance Démocratique. When the AD fused with the Fédération Républicaine to create the Parti Républicain Démocrate, he quickly further rose to prominence in this consolidated liberal right-wing, one of the few voices in parliament to even attempt to push back on some of the Marshal’s initiatives. His skills as a knowledgeable technician have made him indispensable in parliamentary commissions, his advice sought after by the government and across political lines.\n\nIn short, he is an unassuming but unifying figure within Parliament, and as such he was asked to be part of the Government of National Unity after the fall of Marshal Pétain. With the coalition surviving, to the surprise of many, he was the natural compromise between the right and the left. Preferring a largely ceremonial role, in the tradition of the Third Republic, he hopes to lead a renewed regime, parliamentary and liberal."
POLITICS_PHILIPPE_PETAIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1856, by 1914 Philippe Pétain was on his way towards retirement after a discreet and honourable career as innovative military theorist and professor at the École de Guerre. The Great War destroyed any hope of a quiet retirement, however: from the early days of the war, he distinguished himself as a capable and charismatic leader of men, appreciated by his troops to whom he showed paternal care and quickly shot up the ranks, replacing officers who had failed in Belgium and northern France. Then came Verdun, where he issued his iconic order: “Courage, on les aura !”, “Be strong, we’ll get ‘em!”, granting him national fame. His care for proper logistics and morale contributed heavily to the victory, and from then on he was “the Lion of Verdun”. Emboldened by his successes and having earned the respect of the many men that served under him, he was able to restore order during the mutinous mood of 1916, and when the front broke between British and French armies at Amiens in 1918, he was the one who succeeded Supreme Commander Foch and stabilised the front. It was his ideas that permitted the successful counter-attacks, his presence that prevented wider mutiny from occurring. This sadly was not enough to prevent defeat.\n\nAmidst the chaos of the civil war and exile, Pétain held on to his career, and his role in the succesful evacuation of the loyalist forces to Algiers earned him much admiration. Nonetheless, it would be his old superior Ferdinand Foch, not him, who would assume control some months later in a bloodless putsch. Undaunted, Pétain came to be a firm supporter of the new junta, sharing many of his countrymen's belief that a responsible military government would prove to be a unifying force, and get the nation into shape for a future liberation.\nThen, when Foch passed away in 1929, it was Pétain who was destined to fill his shoes, assuming control of the junta largely unchallenged. Since then, he has worked tirelessly to build alliances with both the Croix de Feu and centre-right parties, and has been happy to delegate responsibilities to the Assembly and to civilian politicians when necessary. Nevertheless, he has no intention of doing away with the junta entirely, something which is sure to create tension as time goes by.\nFor now, however, it is Pétain and Pétain alone who is at the helm of France, and the Lion of Verdun bravely roars from the sands of Africa, with but one hope: that one day, he might be laid to rest in the soil of Verdun, alongside the valiant men who he is proud to have led."
POLITICS_CHARLES_DEGAULLE_DESC:0 "Born in 1890 in a well-off, profoundly catholic, royalist family, Charles de Gaulle was raised with a taste for hard work, discipline, and profound love for France. At the age of 15, he wrote a story starring a “General de Gaulle” leading French troops to victory against Germany, avenging the loss of 1870: he has spent his whole life working towards making the dreams of his youth of leading France to victory a reality. An average but hard-working student, he was well-liked by his peers, earning the nickname “the Rooster” for his capacity to assert his authority. He graduated from the Saint-Cyr military academy before joining the ranks of the army as an officer, under the orders of then Colonel Pétain. There he would become his lifelong protégé, serving under Pétain at Verdun, where he was wounded and captured by the Germans. Escaping captivity later on in the war, he quickly became a national symbol of resistance against the aggression of the Boches.\n\nWith the defeat and exile, he became a renowned military theorist and lecturer, remaining close to Pétain and becoming the leader of the “Young Guard”, a clique of younger officers deeply loyal to the Marshal and favouring the military reform ideas of de Gaulle. At the same time, witnessing the parliamentary chaos of the early exile, he became further convinced by the arguments of the Action Française, coming to believe that for France to be reborn, the Republic had to be sacrificed. As such, he entirely supported the initiative of Marshal Pétain to seize power, hoping that in time his mentor too would see the truth in the AF’s arguments, and would abolish the Gueuse. A decade later, this hasn’t happened, but de Gaulle remains hopeful that as he grows in influence, he will be able to restore the monarchy before freeing the nation from the Anti-France."
POLITICS_JEAN_III_DESC:0 "Born in 1874, Jean d’Orléans was for long a picture of aristocratic aloofness. He was after all far down the line of succession of the House of France. Barred from service in the French army, he joined the Danish army for some time, as the king Valdemar was his brother-in-law, before eventually settling in Morocco hoping to promote French interests in the region. The Great War would, however, transform him: once again barred from joining the armies of the Republic, he joined the Medical Service of the Red Cross, transforming his French chateau into a hospital and personally taking care of the wounded. Though with initially little interest in politics, the defeat and break out of the revolution would further convince him of the need for deep reform, bringing him closer to the Action Française. In 1924, following the death of his cousin Philippe d’Orléans without an heir, he was acclaimed by royalists as the rightful pretender to the throne of France. In exile in now German Morocco, he would continue the cooperation with the Integralists started by his predecessors. Royalist efforts were now entirely concentrated around the AF, particularly as the Catholic hierarchy went past their issues with the movement, deeply shocked by the anticlerical violence of the syndicalist revolution. In 1933, he issued a manifesto calling for a “royal government” to save France, instead of a “government of parties”, a clear shot at Pétain’s regime: this would further enhance his political profile in a France-in-exile where the prestige of the Republic was at its lowest and the Marshal’s junta was rapidly losing support.\n\nWith the triumph of Charles de Gaulle against democratic and reformist forces, few were surprised that the new head of state called for a restoration of the monarchy. King Jean III now leads France as it struggles to purge the remnants of the Republic from the nation, and prepares her, the Eldest Daughter of the Church, to the holiest of struggles, a crusade to reconquer the métropole from the Reds."
POLITICS_HENRI_VI_DESC:0 "Born in 1908, young Henri d’Orléans has known exile his whole life. He lived a carefree early childhood on his father’s property in Morocco, where he was found to be a particularly bright child, curious and caring of the various workers of the vast plantation, quickly becoming fluent in French, Arabic, English, German, Italian and Spanish. Soon, however, he would be with his father in his chateau-hospital, being exposed to the horrors of war, before having to flee from the wrath of the revolutionaries. This incident would prove deeply traumatic for Henri, sowing the seeds of a later political awakening. Back in Morocco, he was tutored by the best European tutors, who would introduce him to Integralist thought, which resonated deeply with the youth: not just in its deeply reactionary rhetoric, but most particularly in its advocacy of strict adherence to the Social Doctrine of the Church and economic reform along with corporatist thought. Furthering his studies in Belgium, he discovered for the first time the crowded housing, poor working conditions and terrible anonymity of the lives of the European working poor, as he was attending to their needs as part of Catholic charity efforts. When his father became the head of the House of France in 1924, he became its Dauphin, immediately surrounded by advisors who sought to shape the young man into a worthy King of France. As heir presumptive, now banned from France, the dashing Dauphin nevertheless fully dedicated himself to the royalist cause, working closely with the Action Française despite his personal enmity towards Charles Maurras, as he could recognise that the growing movement was the best chance for restoration of the monarchy. His marriage to his cousin Isabelle de Orléans e Bragança in 1931, and the birth of their son Henri in 1933 created further enthusiasm among royalists: the future of the House of France secured.\n\nOften making discreet trips across the border from Morocco to meet with royalist leaders such as Charles de Gaulle, Henri was instrumental in the struggle that led to the restoration of the monarchy. In the early years of the renewed kingdom, he assisted his ageing father in every way and was often seen as the real power behind the throne, attempting to outmanoeuvre the Action Française about as often as he worked with them. Now in power, King Henri hopes to continue the rebirth of France, to build a monarchy that will last for another thousand years."

Collective punishment, a paralel justice system, forced labour and service in the armed forces, enforced by native elites under the guise of modernisation and spread of civilisation: to say that the Indigénat has created ressentment would be an understatement.

# Intro and starting politics

nfa.1.t:0 "The Situation of the French Republic - History"
nfa.1.d:0 "The Third Republic fell in the same way it came to be: in defeat by German arms and facing socialist unrest. As the civil war that followed the Communard revolution of 1920 eventually came to a close, the government chose exile instead of surrender. Having retreated to Marseilles, they embarked with the French navy towards Algiers, hoping that this temporary situation would soon be resolved as the newly created Federation of Communes of France would undoubtedly either quickly collapse on itself, or be put down by the Boches. Neither happened and instead, a peace treaty was concluded between the German Empire and the Commune, with little to no regard towards the exiled government. The Commune was recognised as the successor of the French Republic by most of the newly German-aligned world, while the exiles remained seen as the legitimate government by those who had fought beside them in the Weltkrieg. But the refugees refused to be cowed: they renewed their claim as the legitimate government of all of France and her empire and their commitment to the Entente, preparing for any opportunity to strike.\n\nHowever, the aftermath of the exile proved highly unstable. With the remnants of the Parliament and mainstream parties thrown into chaos by the defeat and exile, the great commander Ferdinand Foch seized control in a bloodless putsch, ruling at the head of a thinly-veiled junta until his death in 1929. His shoes were filled with ease by his fellow war hero, Phillipe Pétain, the Lion of Verdun. Pétain's rule has, so far, been percieved as less autocratic than his predecessor's, with the Maréchal willing to delegate to the Assembly and civilian politicians when needs be, and chosing to co-operate with the parties of the centre-right, as well as the corporatist Croix de Feu. Nevertheless, he alone is the leader of France, and the constitution remains suspended and ignored, with the military continuing to dominate both politics and the economy, and parliament often sidelined. However, Pétain’s premier, General Maurice Janin, has a less than admirable record of incompetence, and his many blunders may soon catch up with him and his government..."
nfa.1.a:0 "Those Accursed Communards!"

nfa.2.t:0 "The Situation of the French Republic - Political Situation"
nfa.2.d:0 "The circumstances of the revolution and exile have convinced Maréchal Pétain, and a large proportion of the population, that only a dynamic and authoritarian rule can save France, at least until the métropole is liberated. However, both far-right royalists and liberals are increasingly dissatisfied with the regime, and are slowly becoming restless for change. This is not helped by the percieved incompetence of the Premier, Maurice Janin, who has already endangered the government with his blunders before, and may well do so again. Even Pétain's allies in the Croix de Feu and PRD are starting to grow impatient with the political stagnation, and de la Rocque's corporatists are increasingly hindered by internal factionalism, making them hardly the ally they once were. To put it simply, the junta is slowly but surely losing political credibility and is now mainly held together by the prestige of Pétain."
nfa.2.a:0 "We can trust the Lion!"

nfa.3.t:0 "The Situation of the French Republic - Growing Concerns"
nfa.3.d:0 "As if this lack of civilian support wasn’t enough, trust in the Marshal is starting to erode within the army, the backbone of the regime. Pétain’s favouritism towards his protégés has put many in key positions, and though they certainly are competent, many officers are left behind while others worry that this could encourage doctrinal rot, that Pétain is surrounding himself with yesmen. Increasinly, debate is flairing up within his clique, between General de Gaulle and  Admiral Darlan, whose proposals for the Libération are starkly different, over how the military should prepare to free the métropole.\n\nThe most important problem facing the nation, however, is simply its situation, in exile. Though in Algeria, officially annexed as part of France as an overseas department in the late 19th century, exiles and pieds-noirs settlers make up a significant part of the population, in some major cities even making up a majority, overall Europeans are still a small minority ruling over millions of indigènes, who despite being considered Frenchmen are essentially second-class citizens, subject to heavy taxes and forced labour, with rule from Algiers enforced by native elites and the army. Since the defeat in the Weltkrieg, the colonial situation is precarious: unrest is ruthlessly put down, recent famines were badly managed, syndicalist and pan-Arab agents spread propaganda against colonial authorities. However, most traditional indigenous elites are still loyal to France, and there exists a growing class of French-educated natives and native war veterans who despite wanting reform remain loyal. But one thing is clear: if the government is careless, further unrest and perhaps even revolts are bound to happen.\n\n§RBe careful! A failure to keep the resistance in non-core African states under 80 will result in revolts.§!"
nfa.3.a:0 "I’m sure it’s going to be fine!"

nfa.4.t:0 "Death of a Friend"
nfa.4.d:0 "His Majesty George V, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India, friend of France, our great ally during the Great War and since our exile, as well as a personal friend of Marshal Pétain since the two met on the battlefields two decades ago has died today at 70 years old. Though the situation is unfortunately tense at home, given the magnitude of the event it is important for the Entente that the Lion attends the funeral of George V and the coronation of his son Edward, and more personally for Pétain it is important to mourn a friend and ally, who like him oversaw the exile of his people after bloody revolutions in their homelands, and like him was wholeheartedly dedicated to one day come back and retake what is rightfully theirs. And so Marshal Pétain embarked on a special Trans-Atlantic flight, ready to honour the memory of a friend but celebrate a new era of Anglo-French friendship."
nfa.4.a:0 "The King is dead, long live the King!"

nfa.5.t:0 "The Lion in Canada"
nfa.5.d:0 "After a sixty-hour transatlantic flight, Marshal Pétain arrived in Ottawa, greeted by Prime Minister Mackenzie King and a large crowd of Canadians, mostly Québécois who see this state visit as a renewal of Anglo-French cooperation. They then drove to Windsor, where late King-Emperor George had asked to be buried. After a grandiose and emotional ceremony where Pétain was finally able to say farewell to a personal friend and ally, he took a tour of Ontario and Québec, greeted all along the way as a friend of the Empire, before meeting with King Edward VIII. In a pre-planned move, the two men shook hands in front of the media of the world, and the new king declared that no matter the struggles the future holds, the French and British nations would always fight side by side in this great crusade against the syndicalist threat. Later on, the two men held a private talk, discussing current issues facing the Entente, the policies that both men were planning on undertaking, as well as the inevitable prospect of war. The mutual undying commitment of both nations to each other was, of course, renewed, announcing even stronger bonds within the Entente."
nfa.5.a:0 "Time to return home"

committed_to_return_home:0 "Committed to return home"

natfra.6.t:0 "A Murder in the Casbah"
natfra.6.d:0 "Shocking news has reached the nation today. Last night, the retired General Henri Mordacq was found dead in the Casbah, having been stabbed repeatedly and left to bleed out in the gutter. Mordacq had a glittering career in the Great War, successfully holding the town of Arras against the Germans in 1914, and becoming deeply influential in the Clemenceau government. However, he became far too indebted to the Tiger for his own good, and with the fall of the Clemenceau government amidst the revolution and Foch's coup, his political career collapsed. His military career soon followed, with the general staff increasingly wary of his unorthodox theories. Nonetheless, by the time of his death he had become a prolific writer, and his fierce defence of Clemenceau had made him a prominent figure among liberals.\nAlready, the right-wing press, notably the Croix-de-Feu's paper Le Flambeau and of course the Action Française, are pointing the finger at natives, Jews, socialists, and everything in between. Notably, this cause has been taken up by Joseph Darnand. This is the first major scandal to have broken out since he split from the Croix-de-Feu, and he clearly wants to make a success of it, calling in harsh and clear terms for a crackdown on Algerian nationalists.\nMany in the Pétain government, even if they lack the same hysteria, are also now calling for an investigation focused on Arab organisations in the Casbah and possible socialist infiltration, arguing simply and persuasively that these groups were likely behind the old general's death. However, some are arguing that we can't point the finger at any specific group yet, and a much broader investigation is needed. Janin's cabinet has so far been unable to reach a decision, and the premier himself seems dangerously indifferent. As such, the matter has reached Pétain himself, who must now come to a decision."
natfra.6.a:0 "The Arabs were obviously behind this, let's clean up the Casbah."
natfra.6.b:0 "We can't know for sure: maybe we should dig deeper..."

natfra.7.t:0 "The Culprits"
natfra.7.d:0 "After weeks of investigation, loyally aided by numerous white citizens who were present in the Casbah at the time, it has been made clear beyond much doubt that Algerian nationalists were at fault for Mordacq's murder. Although a specific murderer has not yet been found, and those we have rounded up have proved notably resilient under interrogation, it is quite clear to all involved that cells of the socialist and Algerian nationalist ENA, and its associated groups, were responsible.\nAs such, the government has resolved to order a new crackdown on nationalism and native groups across Algeria and the West African colonies, lest this happen again. Meanwhile Joseph Darnand, whose own nephew aided the police during the investigation, has emerged from his first major political test stronger than ever."
natfra.7.a:0 "I want all these Arabs behind bars before sunset!"

natfra.8.t:0 "An Unexpected Arrest"
natfra.8.d:0 "Today, the news splashed across the front pages has astonished most. The murderers of Henri Mordacq have been clearly proven as guilty and rounded up. They are, however, a far cry from the Arabs, Jews, or leftists whom Maurras and Darnand had accused. Rather, the guilty men are outwardly respectable white citizens - and among them, crucially, is Henry Charbonneau, Joseph Darnand's own nephew and a former member of the Action Française, who drifted further to the right and joined more fringe leagues. This connection to the murder has greatly embarassed Darnand, and aroused a great deal of suspicion. Clearly, the circumstances and motives behind Mordacq's death will have to be looked into even further."
natfra.8.a:0 "This doesn't seem right..."

natfra.9.t:0 "La Cagoule"
natfra.9.d:0 "After much investigation and infiltration by the police, the full shocking truth of Mordacq's death has now become clear.\nThe naval veteran and engineer Eugène Deloncle, who had initially supported the AF before leaving it due to his frustration with Maurras's unwillingness to violently seize power, has formed a deep-running and extemsive terrorist organisation, up to now in total secrecy. Deloncle's organisation, dubbed "La Cagoule" by the AF writer Maurice Pujo, due to the cowls they wear in their initiation rituals, seemingly sought to inspire harsher crackdowns against liberals and Arab nationalists, as well as further radicalise the French right, by framing leftist or Arab groups for terror attacks, as happened in the case of Mordacq.\nThe group, it is clear, has enjoyed the support of several notable industrialists, most notably the founder of L'Oréal, Eugène Schueller, and countless previously respected figures have been implicated in the scandal. Most prominently among these is Joseph Darnand himself, now revealed to be an active member of the organisation, and directly complicit in the death of the general. Although an attempt was made to bring him to justice, his home was found abandoned, and it is believed that he has fled across the sea to Romania."
natfra.9.a:0 "Terrorist scum!"

natfra.10.t:0 "Janin's Plan"
natfra.10.d:0 "Pétain's premier, Maurice Janin, has few redeeming features. He is uncharismatic, unmotivated, incompetent, and prone to political blunders. He is, however, loyal, and it is that loyalty that has inspired him to come to the Maréchal today with an undesirable, if necessary, proposal. Janin intends to pay off a large deputies in the Assembly to approve his planned laws for re-armament and military investment. Although Janin knows that such corrupt measures are far from ideal, and could cause significant problems if leaked, he is certain that it is the only way forward, in light of growing frustration with his government and abilities. Reluctantly, the old Marshal can only agree."
natfra.10.a:0 "Let's at least hope this can be kept quiet..."

natfra.11.t:0 "The Scandal Breaks"
natfra.11.d:0 "In news that surprised few in the know, Janin's corruption has today been exposed, in all its sordid detail. Elaborate bribes, distrubing threats, even promises to turn a blind eye to blatantly illegal activity in exchange for support: all have been common practices of the Janin government, and all have intensified recently as Janin makes a belated effort to strenghten his hand. Everyone from the staunch liberal Camille Chautemps to Charles Maurras and Joseph Darnand has harshly rebuked not only Janin but Pétain himself, and although Janin's own fall from power is now a certainty, some even speculate that the Junta itself is on the way out."
natfra.11.a:0 "Ah, muerde..."

natfra.12.t:0 "Janin's Resignation"
natfra.12.d:0 "Today, the inevitable came to pass, and, after two days spent locked away in his office, Maurice Janin gave a short, regretful speech to a jeering assembly, announcing his immediate resignation. It is clear that Pétain himself had forced him out, threatening that if he didn't go quietly he would lose not only his rank in the army but his liberty as well. And thus fell the Janin regime, ineffectual and shambolic to the end. Pétain's next move as he attempts to stabilise the situation is for now unknown, but members of the Croix-de-Feu, PRD, and even AF have all been seen meeting with representatives of the junta."
natfra.12.a:0 "What lies next?"

natfra.13.t:0 "Our Next Move"
natfra.13.d:0 "Ever since Janin resigned, the Republic has been without any Prime Minister, and the junta has been in chaos, with Pétain forced to take on the daily administrative responsibilites that he has grown used to delegating. Meanwhile, protests supported by everyone from liberals to legionaires are continuing in the streets, and we are running out of time to stabilise the situation. As such, two possibilites lie before Pétain.\nFirst, as is suggested by many, he could seek to gain the support of civilian politicians, through more... legitimate means than Janin had used. This would entail entering into discussions with either François de la Rocque, leader of the Croix-de-Feu and darling of the far right, or Louis Marin, leader of the centre-right Fédération Républicain. Either man would be able to use his political prestige and support base to restore confidence in the regime, but would also demand extensive concessions in exchnage for doing so: something which has isnpired some Pétain loyalists to urge the Maréchal not to bother talking to any politicians. Civilian politics, they argue, is responsible for dragging France into the chaos it currently faces, and it is time for Pétain to fully secure the junta's position and bend the Assembly to his will.\nThe old marshal must chose a course of action, but he has little time..."
natfra.13.a:0 "Arrange a meeting with de la Rocque, we need nationalist backing."
natfra.13.b:0 "We have to maintain the basis of the Republic: reach out to Marin."
natfra.13.c:0 "Enough is enough. Declare martial law in Algiers!"

natfra.14.t:0 "A Meeting with the Colonel"
natfra.14.d:0 "As faithfully arranged by Pétain's supporters, the Lion of Verdun, the respected commander of the Great War, has met with François de la Rocque, a heroic common soldier from the same conflict. While Pétain rose first to the position of Foch's right-hand man, de la Rocque became active in veterans' groups, joining the right-wing Croix-de-Feu in 1927 and taking it over two years later, the same year that Pétain succeeded the late Foch as President. Since them, de la Rocque has greatly expanded his organisation from a vaguely nationalistic group for disgruntled old soldiers to a formidabble political movement, advocating for corporatist economics, French nationalism, and a strong Presidency. Perhaps predictably, the Croix-de-Feu has so far been glad to support the Junta, gaining the votes of many of Pétain's sympathisers among the public and has been vital in maintaining parliamentary support for the junta.\nAlthough de la Rocque now promises that he will continue to stand by Pétain no matter what, he today suggested to the Marshal that appointing a new cabinet, dominated by members of the Croix-de-Feu, with himself as Premier, would go a long way to resolving the crisis. He is, indeed, correct. With open backing from de la Rocque's newspaper, Le Flambeau, his paramilitary "dispos", and from his extensive support base, the junta will surely be able to move on from the crisis. Nonetheless, some allies are cautioning Pétain that granting de la Rocque such influence may well lead to the end of the junta, with de la Rocque slowly displacing the Maréchal."
natfra.14.a:0 "We must be sure of his backing, we have to accept."
natfra.14.b:0 "He'll stay loyal anyway: we don't need to give him so much power."

natfra.15.t:0 "The de la Rocque Cabinet"
natfra.15.d:0 "Today, Pétain appeared before the assembly to give an extensive speech, broadcast to the nation over radio, admitting the failings of the junta and acknowledging the need for reform. With that in mind, he went on to announce that the popular right-wing nationalist, Colonel François de la Rocque, would be appointed as his new premier, with a cabinet dominated by the Colonel's allies in his party and in business. This is a significant change in direction for the junta, as de la Rocque, despite his military past, left the army shortly after the war, and is thus the first civilian Premier since Foch's coup. Such a major step has astonished many around the world, and, although the nature of de la Rocque's policies hardly makes this a sign of liberalisation, the sun may be setting on the Junta."
natfra.15.a:0 "Good luck, Premier de la Rocque!"

natfra.16.t:0 "Martial Law"
natfra.16.d:0 "With the crisis dragging on, and his opportunities to form political alliances either exhausted or refused, Maréchal Pétain today took the drastic step of declaring martial law in Algiers, citing "the ongoing struggle against syndicalism" as his formal reason. Of course, this has confused few, and it is obvious that he intends simply to consolidate his own power. Later in the day, a large number of soldiers, led by General de Gaulle entered the Assembly. Reluctantly unchallenged by the liberals and greeted with cheers by the delegates of the Croix-de-Feu, they presented a simple bill, declaring full support for Phillipe Pétain and recognising him as both President and Prime Minister. The motion was adopted near-unanimously, and the handful that voteed against it were promptly placed under arrest.\nNow, young soldiers patrol the streets of Algiers, rounding up Arab nationalists in the Casbah and liberal dissidents in the European quarter. Opposition to Pétain will doubtless fast evaporate, as politicians scramble to save their careers and freedom. Although it has taken brute force to secure the junta, and some condemnation may come our way, this alone could have saved France."
natfra.16.a:0 "Vive le Maréchal!"

natfra.17.t:0 "A Meeting with Marin"
natfra.17.d:0 "As faithfully arranged by Pétain's supporters, the Lion of Verdun, the respected commander of the Great War, has met with Louis Marin, a conservative politician and staunch republican. When Foch assumed control of the government, Marin was one of many centrist politicians who reluctantly accepted the junta as a stabilising force. Over the 1920s, he came to staunchly defend the Foch regime from both its opponents and his own party, and with the tacit backing of the Junta, took charge of the Fédération Républicain, a Catholic conservative party nonetheless commited to the Republic. When Pétain succeeded Foch in 1929, Marin aided in the smooth transition of power, and has since been a prominent, if reluctant, supporter of the regime in the assembly. Pétain for his part has been willing to delegate policymaking and day-to-day administration to the PRD, among other parliamentary allies.\nHowever, Marin is now suggesting that only reforms can restore the people's confidence in Pétain's government. As such, he is urging the Maréchal to appoint him as the new Premier, with a cabinet made up of liberals and republicans, to slowly prepare the French nation for a return to democratic life, once the Métropole is liberated. However, many in Pétain's clique argue that we cannot risk allowing liberals too much influence, and that parliamentary chaos must be avoided."
natfra.17.a:0 "Reform is the way forward, accept his proposals."
natfra.17.b:0 "Politicians' bickering got us into this mess in the first place!"

natfra.18.t:0 "The Marin Cabinet"
natfra.18.d:0 "Today, Pétain appeared before the assembly to give an extensive speech, broadcast to the nation over radio, admitting the failings of the junta and acknowledging the need for reform. With that in mind, he went on to announce that the veteran conservative and republican, Louis Marin, would be appointed as his new premier, with a cabinet dominated by republican politicians and liberal-minded businessmen. This is a significant change in direction for the junta, Marin, a longstanding deputy and leader of the Parti Républicain Démocrate, is the first civilian Premier since Foch's coup. Such a major step has astonished many around the world, and, although Marin would certainly have had to accept the continuation of the Pétain presidency to get this far, this may well be a sign of steps towards democratisation."
natfra.18.a:0 "Good luck, Premier Marin!"

natfra.19.t:0 "Time's Running Out" 
natfra.19.d:0 "Having turned down his allies' overtures, and with the protests ongoing, Pétain is an increasingly difficult position. Although both de la Rocque and Marin have promised that they will continue to stand by the junta, our refusal to make meaningful concessions to either man has certainly ensured that their support will be hardly vigorous in the coming weeks. And, with the protesters going nowhere, this won't be enough.\nWith this in mind, multiple allies of Pétain, including both General de Gaulle and Admiral Darlan, are now once again urging the Maréchal to declare martial law, argung that civilian politics has lead to this chaos, and that it is time for us to move on from it for good, if the junta is to live on and the métropole is to be retaken. However, others are urging us to make discreet overtures to various far-right leagues, to see if their support will bolster our imgage."
natfra.19.a:0 "Enough is enough: martial law it is."
natfra.19.b:0 "We can do this legitimately if we gain the leagues' support."

natfra.20.t:0 "Maurras's Gambit"
natfra.20.d:0 "Having been quietly contacted by associates of the President looking for backing, Charles Maurras, the political philosopher and dominant politician of the Orléanist monarchist and integral-nationalist Action Française, has seemingly formed a clear impression that the junta has become desperate for support. It is with this in mind, it appears, that he and his allies in the AF today announced a new motion in the assembly, to formally lift the law of exile against royal pretenders, allowing them back into France. Although this is not an outright effort at restoring the monarchy, it is the crucial first step to doing so, and thus an extremely ambitious move on the part of Maurras.\nEspecially telling was Maurras's humble request, repeated in later speeches by Maurice Pujo and Henri Massis, for the support of President Pétain in his efforts. Of course, such an endorsement of Maurras's move would allow the act to pass with ease, and lead on to a restoration of the monarchy. But, it would seem, Maurras won't take anything less in exchange for his support."
natfra.20.a:0 "We need allies, give him our backing."
natfra.20.b:0 "This is too far: we can't allow the republic itself to be destroyed!"

natfra.21.t:0 "The Unlikely Alliance"
natfra.21.d:0 "With the law of exile having been repealed with Pétain's backing, Jean d'Orléans, the Duc de Guise and Orléanist claimant to the throne, has arrived amidst royalist celebrations in Algiers. He was also greeted by General de Gaulle, a clear sign of the junta's growing willingness to back monarchism, as well as a reminder of de Gaulle's own royalist instincts. Many now predict a restoration of the Orléans monarchy within the near future, claims that the junta has been hesitant to deny.\nMeanwhile, the newspaper and supporters of the Action Française have taken a firmly pro-junta stance recently, rallying around Pétain as the presumed saviour of their hopes of a restoration, and encouraged in this by Maurras and Pujo. Confronted in the streets by the AF's paramilitary Camelots du Roi, the protests have also begun to fade away. A new mood of optimism has set in around the Presidential palace, and Pétain is glad that the tide has finally turned in his favour." 
natfra.21.a:0 "All as planned!"

natfra.22.t:0 "A Spanner in the Works"
natfra.22.d:0 "Until today, all has been going well and smoothly in our collaboration with Maurras and the AF. Most have come to believe that the junta will live on, even if the monarchy will return. However, things became notably more complicated today.\nWith the repeal of the law of exile having allowed every royal claimant to return, Louis Bonaparte, claimant to the throne of the French Empire, arrived in Tunis today. This has considerably disrupted our plans for a smooth consolidation of power, with the roots of a resurgent Bonapartism now beginning to grow: having to chose between two royal houses is less than desriable. Many of Pétain's allies, including de Gaulle, simply argue that we should ignore Bonaparte. The Empire fell in 1870, and there is no organised political movement equivalent to the Action Française that can fight for its restoration.\nHowever, others, including François Darlan, are arguing that this is a good opportunity not to let Maurras's influence grow too out of hand, and that we should tacitly support Bonaparte."
natfra.22.a:0 "We owe Maurras our loyalty: ignore him."
natfra.22.b:0 "We should be wary of the AF's power, endorse Bonaparte."

natfra.23.t:0 "Pétain's Speech"
natfra.23.d:0 "Today in Algiers, President Pétain, flanked by military loyalists and Action Française politicians alike, gave an extensive and charismatic speech, detailing the failures of the Republic. Blaming the inherent weakness and infighting of parliamentary rule for the defeat in both the Great War and revolution, and in the short term for the corruption that brought down Marin, Pétain declared that only a return to monarchical rule, under the House of Orléans, could save France, and that preparations would be made for a restoration. The old marshal also proceeded to announce a new cabinet, dominated by prominent members of the AF.\nWith monarchists celebrating in the streets, and both Maurras and the Duc de Guise having declared their happiness at this turn of events, it is clear that the future if France is a future under its King."
natfra.23.a:0 "Vive le Roi de demain!"

natfra.24.t:0 "Maurras's Anger"
natfra.24.d:0 "With Pétain having publicly given his tacit support to the young Louis Bonaparte's claim to the throne, the Orléanist Action Fran����aise, which has so far been invaluable to our efforts to preserve the junta, has been thrown into a fury. Senior members of the AF have stormed out of meetings with Pétain loyalists, and Charles Maurras's own less than flattering remarks about the President have been eagerly picked up by sensationalists in the press.\nWith this new crisis threatening to undermine our continued control in power, many within Pétain's clique, notably General de Gaulle, are strongly urging the Maréchal to mkae a necessary U-turn and cut off his support for the Bonapartists, and thus seek to again placate the AF. However, many others insist that by distancing ourselves from the AF, we made the right choice, stopping our influence from growing unchecked. Turning around now, they argue, would be humiliatimg, and we should instead dig in our support of the Bonapartist claim, and weather the storm."
natfra.24.a:0 "We've come this far in support of Bonapartism; we can't backtrack now."
natfra.24.b:0 "We have to eat our words and try to find a settlement with Maurras."

natfra.25.t:0 "The Third Empire"
natfra.25.d:0 "With Pétain having doggedly supported the Louis Bonaparte for several weeks now, in the face of anger from liberals and the far right alike, few were surprised today, when President Pétain declared the Third Republic to be at an end. In a simple and brief act, obediently passed by Pétain's allies in the assembly in spite of the Orléanist AF delegates storming out, the French Empire, the great nation which once had stretched from Haiti to Moscow, was reborn. Louis Napoleon, having met repeatedly with Pétain over the past weeks, was declared Emperor and a formal coronation is said to be under preparation.\nAlthough many came to predict such a move, the restoration of a largely discredited monarchy, which has never had a political movement to continue its legacy like the Orléanists, has come as a profound shock to almost everyone. Nevertheless, most citizens have taken a positive attitude to the restoration, and have come to hope that the young Louis, with the loyal aid of the Lion of Verdun, can restore the greatness of his ancestor."
natfra.25.a:0 "Vive l'Empereur, et Vive la France!"

natfra.26.t:0 "An Offer from Darnand"
natfra.26.d:0 "With political instability ongoing, and the rift between the junta and far right only increasing, something must be done. And it seems, at last, that we have a solution. The minor but nonetheless increasingly popular far right leader, Joseph Darnand, who claims inspiration from the Romanian legionaires, has approached Pétain, Maurras, and de la Rocque with a proposal for a "meeting of national pacification" chaired by himself. Describing his goal asthe unity of the French right behind Pétain, to strenghten and bring together the nation in preparation for the liberation, Darnand believes that his relatively fringe position to the other men will let him position himself as a compromise candidate and a mediator between them, in spite of his being significantly more radical than the others.\nEven if darnand himself can find little goodwill among Pétain's clique, most of the Maréchal's advisors are urging that we take the opportunity to attempt to further unite the nation. Time, they insist, is running out to resolve the crisis, and we must take this opportunity to find allies."
natfra.26.a:0 "We need a united nation, arrange the meeting."
natfra.26.b:0 "How can a seditious radical restore unity where we have failed?"

natfra.27.t:0 "The Meeting of National Pacification"
natfra.27.d:0 "Charles Maurras and François de la Rocque, the two great rivals of the French right, faced each other uneasily from opposite sides of the table. Staring distractedly out of the window of the Presidential Palace, de la Rocque looked down on the sprawl of Algiers below. Maurras, meanwhile, gazed at the large Presidential Standard on the wall opposite, admiring the detail of Pétain's axe symbol. The impending arrival of President Pétain himself, not to mention that of the upstart Darnand, hardly reduced the tension. In spite of their many differences, neither man could understand what Pétain saw in this deluded legionaire, or how Darnand could possibly think he could stabilise the nation. But they had both needed to appear commited to national unity, and so they had both obediently arrived at the palace an hour before.\nThe patter of footsteps began to resonate from the corridor outside, and Maurras and de la Rocque alike braced themselves for long hours of argument, both knowing it would be in vain. They heard the doors open, and what seemed to be the President commenting to an aide.\n\nAnd then, the bomb went off, and all the tension, all the rivalry, was swept away in fire and chaos."
natfra.27.a:0 "Quelle catastrophe!"

natfra.28.t:0 "The Saviour of France"
natfra.28.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Presidential Palace bombing, the entire nation and administration fell into chaos. With Charles Maurras and François de la Rocque both dead, their parties rapidly fell into chaos, amidst infighting and, more importantly, total shock and astonishment at what had happened. President Pétain, for his part, was rushed to hospital in a critical condition, leaving him unable to maintain order while his allies squabbled among themselves. \nIt was only Joseph Darnand who could offer the vision, determination, and strength needed to save France in its hour of need. With the bomb having gone off mere minutes before he arrived at the palace, he was at the centre of events from the start. His natural charisma soon allowed him to take charge of the efforts to maintain order, ensuring that the President could safely get to hospital. Shortly afterwards, understanding the gravity of the situation and how thoroughly France had been betrayed by its politicians, he ordered his loyal militiamen to storm the assembly. With the whole administration thrown into chaos, the brave men faced no resistance, and it was not long before Darnand addressed the nation over the radio.\nA nefarious plot, he declared, had unfolded this day. The communards, bankrolled and aided by the Jews and Freemasons not only of Algiers but of the entire world, and using Algerian nationalists as useful idiots, had conspired to kill Pétain. And just how close their plot had come to success, Darnand stated, only showed how complicit the political class was in this disgraceful plot against France itself. The liberals in the assembly, the Jews, the Masonic lodge of Algiers, the natives: every vile force opposed to the French Race had come together this day, and it was through his leadership and the glory of France alone that they had failed. Only a radical, indeed revolutionary, reorganisation of the French State, he announced, could save France from its foes. Shortly afterwards, having regained consciousness in hospital, a shaken Marshal Pétain confirmed Darnand as Premier."
natfra.28.a:0 "Pour l'ordre nouveau!"

natfra.29.t:0 "Charles de Gaulle Appointed Premier"
natfra.29.d:0 "Since the declaration of Martial Law, Maréchal Pétain himself has ruled as both Premier and President. However, he has never been suited to day-to-day administration, and his duties as Head of State and military position leave him with little time for this anyway. As such, the Maréchal has appointed General Charles de Gaulle, a loyal member of Pétain's clique, as the new Premier of France. With his influence having been much strenghthened by the adoption of his proposals for the liberation of the métropole, de Gaulle's appointment has come as a surprise to few, and many in the country have high hopes for his adminstration."
natfra.29.a:0 "Bonne chance, Monsieur le Premier!"

natfra.30.t:0 "François Darlan Appointed Premier"
natfra.30.d:0 "Since the declaration of Martial Law, Maréchal Pétain himself has ruled as both Premier and President. However, he has never been suited to day-to-day administration, and his duties as Head of State and military position leave him with little time for this anyway. As such, the Maréchal has appointed Admiral François Darlan, a loyal member of Pétain's clique, as the new Premier of France. With his influence having been much strenghthened by the adoption of his proposals for the liberation of the métropole, Darlan's appointment has come as a surprise to few, and many in the country have high hopes for his adminstration."
natfra.30.a:0 "Bonne chance, Monsieur le Premier!!"

natfra.31.t:0 "The Future of the PRD"
natfra.31.d:0 "For several years now, the Parti Républicain Démocrate, a fusion of right-wing parties formed after the exile, has staunchly if pragmatically supported the junta. Under its leader, Louis Marin, a veteran of the French centre-right, the PRD has provided vital backing to Pétain within the assembly, and their continued support has been deeply helpful for our public image since martial law was declared. However, some within Pétain's clique are now urging the Maréchal to dissolve the party, arguing that their moderate and democratic stance will prove problematic for the junta's consolidation. Others, however, argue that it would be more convenient for everyone if we were instead to ensure their loyalty, by offering favourable treatment and government posts in exchange for Marin accepting democratisation to be off the cards."
natfra.31.a:0 "We can't trust democratic-minded civilians, dissolve the party!"
natfra.31.b:0 "Offer them government positions in exhnage for loyalty."

natfra.32.t:0 "The Question of the Croix-de-Feu"
natfra.32.d:0 "With the junta's consolidation of power continuing, the future of our erstwhile allies in the Catholic Corporatist Croix-de-Feu is being increasingly called into question. Many of Pétain's allies are growing concerned about the ambitions of its leader, Colonel François de la Rocque, and his extensive and growing cult of personality. As such, Pétain is now facing calls to reign in the movement, and to cut off de la Rocque from excessive publicity. However, others argue that we have a good opportunity to take advantage of the party's populairty. If de la Rocque can be made to affirm his loyalty to Pétain, they argue, his support will surely translate into support for Pétain. With the Croix-de-Feu currently only growing stronger and stronger, we must decide our stance towards them sooner rather than later."
natfra.32.a:0 "We need to clip de la Rocque's wings before he gets too full of himself."
natfra.32.b:0 "His popularity will only help us if he's on our side."

natfra.33.t:0 "Pétain's Speech"
natfra.33.d:0 "In his first major public appearance since Martial Law was declared, Philippe Pétain today declared that the old constitution, the old institutions, of the Third Republic, long since discarded anyway, had conclusively failed, and that the recent turbulence was all the proof for this that anyone needed. As such, declared the Maréchal, a new constitution would be drafted by the goverment, to ensure the 'strong and orderly government that alone can free the patrie'. This formalisation of the military's grip on power has surprised few, but already debates are flaring up within the government as to what shape the constitution should eventually take."
natfra.33.a:0 "Let's hope the new one lasts longer than what we have now..."

natfra.34.t:0 "The Fate of the Assembly"
natfra.34.d:0 "As the drafting of the new constitution continues, we shall have to address the future of the Assembly. Many within the junta are arguing that we should take the opportunity to strip the Assembly of any remnants of its power, and state in the constitution that its function is purely to advise the executive. However, others claim that this could be seen as an unjust power-grab. The military has informally controlled the Assembly for over a decade anyway, they argue, and officialising their lack of power would only cause undue controversy."
natfra.34.a:0 "Formally reduce the Assembly to an advisory institution."
natfra.34.b:0 "We control it unoficially anyway, there's no need."

natfra.35.t:0 "The Role of the Presidency"
natfra.35.d:0 "With the drafting of the constitution underway, the formal powers of the Presidency are now being debated. In the third republic, Presidents lacked much real power, and instead functioned as ceremonial heads of state, with the Premier controlling the government. However, after the exile, Foch and then Pétain both assumed strong emergency powers, both formally and informally centralising government around the office of the President. Of course, strong Presidential power must continue, but Pétain's aides are debating whether the constitution should grant an unprecedented level of official power in the Presidency, or we should maintain the current situation, with Pétain's influence remaining often informal, but very much present."
natfra.35.a:0 "We may as well formalise Pétain's powers."
natfra.35.b:0 "There's no need to fix what isn't broken: soft power works fine."

natfra.36.t:0 "The Powers of the Army"
natfra.36.d:0 "Through the rule of Pétain, and by extension his many loyalists within the military, the army has essentially come to control National France. For years now our government has been often labelled a military junta, but now, with Pétain's new consitution being drafted, his allies are divided on the extent to which the army's power should be recognised. Many believe that the normal of the institutions of the republic work fine, and we can simply maintain the junta bty appointing military men to key positions, as we have done before. However, others argue that the constitution is an opportunity for a more fundamental step away from civilian politics, and that we should formally give broad governmental powers to the institution of the Army itself."
natfra.36.a:0 "Give the army official powers in the administration."
natfra.36.b:0 "Just appoint military men to "civilian" posts."

natfra.37.t:0 "The Constitution is Adopted"
natfra.37.d:0 "Today, having been unanimously voted for by the Assembly and signed by President Pétain, the new Constitution of the French National State was formally adopted.\nIn spite of Pétain's ongoing consolidation of dictatorial power, and the military junta's evident distaste for civilian politics, the final document of the Consitution has not gone as far some had hoped, and others had feared, it would, in granting official power to Pétain and the army. Many of the fundamental institutions of the Republic have been left largely intact, and Pétain has stopped short of tearing down every check on his power.\nNevertheless, it is clear that Pétain's dictatorship has been altogether preserved, and that although the Republic's institutions largely live on, they will in practice be controlled by the President and junta. Most, however, are simply glad that a sense of political stability and confidence has returned, and that the nation as a whole can now turn its attention to the liberation, its one great purpose."
natfra.37.a:0 "Vive le Maréchal, et Vive la France!"

natfra.38.t:0 "The Constitution is Adopted"
natfra.38.d:0 "Today, having been unanimously voted for by the Assembly and signed by President Pétain, the new Constitution of the French National State was formally adopted.\nWith Pétain's blatant consolidation of dictatorial power ongoing, few were surprised that the final document of the Constitution swept away, or at least made irrelevant, many republican institutions, and gave Pétain and the junta extensive powers. No longer, it is clear, will the junta be held back by the remnants of the checks and balances of the Third Republic.\nWith Pétain's dictatorship now stronger than ever, and entirely formalised by the Constitution, French politics has greatly changed, with the Maréchal's optimistic supporters hoping that divisive civilian politics is gone for good. Most, however, are simply glad that a sense of political stability and confidence has returned, and that the nation as a whole can now turn its attention to the liberation, its one great purpose."
natfra.38.a:0 "Vive le Maréchal, et Vive la France!"

natfra.39.t:0 "The Focus of the Chantiers de la Jeunesse"
natfra.39.d:0 "Now that we have established a program of "youth workshops", or camps for young men to stay at in order to learn loyalty and service to France, we must decide on what the main purpose of these camps will be. Many of Pétain's more conservative allies want the camps to focus on teaching the youth traditional values and strong morality, while other members of the junta would prefer for young men to mainly be taught support for the junta, and devotion to the Maréchal, in order to ensure the loyalty of the next generation. Many in the army, however, instead want the camps to mainly provide basic training and physical fitness programs, to prepare young men for military service."
natfra.39.a:0 "Teach the youth traditional morality."
natfra.39.b:0 "Teach them loyalty to Pétain."
natfra.39.c:0 "Focus on getting them fit for the army."

natfra.40.t:0 "Marianne et Maréchal"
natfra.40.d:0 "As Pétain's personality cult continues to grow, some of the old marshal's supporters have now begun replacing busts of Marianne, symbolic incarnation of freedom and thee Republic, with busts off Pétain himself. While the loyalty that this demonstrates is of course commendable, many of our more democratically-inclined citizens are concerned by this, fearing that it demonstrates that Pétain is sweeping away the Republic in its entirety, and the essence of France with it. As the controversy grows, we shall have to take a side."
natfra.40.a:0 "Pétain is a heroid patriot, what better symbol of the Republic is there than his image?"
natfra.40.b:0 "This is too far, politely ask our supporters for Marianne's busts to go back up."

natfra.41.t:0 "Criteria for Government Contracts"
natfra.41.d:0 "With the junta having resolved to further deepen its ties with French businessmen, knowing that their financial and material support is crucial for the liberation, we must decide on our criteria for awarding government contracts. Many within Pétain's clique believe that there are still too many democratic sympathisers in business for us to award contracts lightly, and that loyalty to Pétain should be our first concern. Others, however, argue that this will lead to inefficiency and corruption, and that we must award contractts fairly, even if it compromises our ideological consistency."
natfra.41.a:0 "There is no qualification more important than loyalty."
natfra.42.b:0 "Focus on their competence, not their politics."

natfra.42.t:0 "Allegations of Corruption"
natfra.42.d:0 "Over the past months, the junta has conspicuously tightened its bonds with various loyal businesses in National France. However, allegations are starting to surface in the less loyal elements of the press, and in simple rumours, of a blatant corruption that goes far beyond simply favouring the more supportive businessmen for contracts. Many within the government are urging Pétain to act quickly and crack down on any such behaviour, lest we see a repeat of the Janin scandal. However, others point out that times have changed since then, and that we are now in a better position to simply crush the rumours before they become embarrassing."
natfra.42.a:0 "We don't need to worry about public outcry any more: crush the sedition."
natfra.43.b:0 "This could become a problem, introduce anti-corruption campaigns."

natfra.43.t:0 "Democratic Sympathisers Gain Government Contracts"
natfra.43.d:0 "With the junta having disregarded loyalty to Pétain in favour of competence in the process to gain government contracts, an unsettling trend has emerged of businessmen gaining contracts whose previous political records are far from attractive to Pétain's loyalists. Many men who had previously given large funds to liberal parties, and in some cases had even publicly citicised the government, are now working on vital projects for the state. This could be deeply embarrassing for us if it gets out, and could leave the junta vulnerable: after all, who knows what contacts they still maintain with enemies of the government? Before this gets any further, we must settle our stance towards this problem."
natfra.43.a:0 "If they still wanted to bring down Pétain they wouldn't be working for him: leave them be."
natfra.43.b:0 "Tighten vetting requirements for loyalty to the junta."

natfra.44.t:0 "Revival of Great War History"
natfra.44.d:0 "As the junta further consolidates its power, many sympathetic intellectuals and scholars have started promoting a revival of the history of the Great War, with a large number of new assesments of the conflict having recently been released. Notably, these books emphasise the competence and succeses of France's officer corps, not least Pétain himself, and the bravery of common soldiers. Such a celebration of the French military thus leaves the blame for defeat with the civilian politicians of the war, who are accused of having doomed France through their infighting and weakness, an accusation that chimes well with Pétain's own rhetoric about the divisive and weak nature of parliamentary democracy. In all, this new historical trend is a triumph for the junta's image and prestige."
natfra.44.a:0 "Hurrah!"

natfra.45.t:0 "How to Celebrate Pétain?" 
natfra.45.d:0 "Now that we are seeking to bolster the existing cult of personality around Maréchal Pétain, some debate has arisen among the regimes propagandists as to what exactly he should be celebrated for. All agree that a consistent narrative is key to effective propaganda, but what that narrative should put emphasis on is disputed, with some wanting us to focus on Pétain's devout Catholicism and patriotism, and others believing that it would be more effective amidst a tense global situation to remind the people of his heroism and successes during the Great War."
natfra.45.a:0 "Emphasise his military successes."
natfra.45.b:0 "Emphasise his faith and patriotism."

natfra.46.t:0 "The Extent of Desecularisation"
natfra.46.d:0 "As we seek to ally with the Catholic Church in order to further our traditionalist policies and bolster the junta's support, we will have to end the deep secularism of the Third Republic to gain good relations with the Church. However, the government is divided over how far we should go in desecularising France. Many believe that it would be simplest to just repeal the legislation which has up to now repressed the Catholic Church. However, others, Charles de Gaulle notable among them, are now stating that the time has come to go further, and outright restore Roman Catholicism as the state relgiion of France."
natfra.46.a:0 "We need State Catholicism to guide the people forward."
natfra.46.b:0 "Removing anti-Catholic laws is enough to please the Church."

natfra.47.t:0 "Pétain and the Pope"
natfra.47.d:0 "With Roman Catholicism having been enshrined some months ago as the state religion of France, President Pétain today made a state visit to Rome. After meeting with [ITA.GetLeader], and ensuring promises of further economic co-operation and friendship, Pétain made his way to the Vatican, where he met with the Pope. The two men, official reports state, discussed personal matters of faith, before Pétain assured His Holiness that National France would always be ready to protect the Holy See, and his government would do all it could to protect the Church and its followers, not only in France but arounf the world."
natfra.47.a:0 "With the support of His Holiness, nobody can stop us!"

natfra.48.t:0 "The Ideology of the Révolution Nationale"
natfra.48.d:0 "With Pétain having now announced a "national revolution" to sweep away all that has so far held France and its people back, and stating that this will be the ideological basis of his regime, we must now claarify what this ideology in fact promotes. Pétain's old friends within the army largely want us to centre it around militarism and French nationalism, while the Catholic conservatives whom Pétain has more recently aligned would prefer a program of traditionalism and morality. Others, meanwhile, believe we should simply centre our "ideology" around Pétain himself, and use it as an extension of his cult of personality."
natfra.48.a:0 "Militarism and nationalism will restore glory to France!"
natfra.48.b:0 "Only a moral people under God stands a chance of liberating the patrie!"
natfra.48.c:0 "Pétain alone knows what is best for the nation!"

natfra.49.t:0 "Support from the Archbishop of Algiers"
natfra.49.d:0 "Today, in front of his large congregation, Auguste-Fernand Leynaud, Archbishop of Algiers, called on all French Catholics to strive for the liberation of their homeland and of their Catholic brothers and sisters, currently suffering under Communard tyranny. Although many Catholics were disappointed by Pétain's reluctance to fully restore Catholicism as the state religion, Leynaud's excellent sermon has gone a long way to helping Pétain build a support base among conservative Catholics."
natfra.49.a:0 "Excellent!"

natfra.50.t:0 "Darnand Breaks with the Croix-de-Feu"
natfra.50.d:0 "François de la Rocque's Catholic corporatist Croix-de-Feu, a major ally of the junta in the Assembly, today suffered a significant setback. The party has long been a broad-tent coalition, united mainly by de la Rocque's own charisma and by a shared distrust for liberal democracy. However, the tensions caused by this have clearly reached a boiling point, with some of the party's hardliners under Joseph Darnand, splitting off entirely to form a new "Chevaliers du Glaive" party.\nClaiming inspiration from the legionaries in Romania, and seeking to defend French racial purity and restore French power in Europe, Darnand has notably proclaimed his absolute loyalty to the Pétain government, in what we can only assume is a ploy for influence in the junta. Nevertheless, Darnand's group remains on the extreme fringe, and his radicalism is regarded with suspicion by much of the population, while Pétain's allies in the junta have no interest in working with him. If anything, his split from the Croix-de-Feu has harmed de la Rocque through exposing the divisions in his own party, more than it has helped Darnand."
natfra.50.a:0 "We can safely ignore this lunatic."

natfra.51.t:0 "The End of the Republic"
natfra.51.d:0 "Over the past weeks, the junta has been greatly stabilised, buoyed by the backing of the Action Française both in its newspaper and on the streets. This has come, however, at a dear price, and it seems that the royalists have finally gotten their way.\nAs such, Philippe Pétain today announced, flanked by prominent members of the AF, that the Third Republic, having been proven by the defeat in the Great War, the revolution, and now the fall of Janin to be unwirkable, was no more. In its place, to seek true unity and revive the genuine spirit of France, the Orléans monarchy would be restored under Jean, Duc de Guise.\nAlthough most commentators saw this coming when the junta and AF began collaborating, it has nevertheless came as a great shock to the nation, and most Frenchmen barely know what to make of such a seismic political shift. Nevertheless, the dominant mood appears to be relief that the crisis is over, and a hope that the monarchy will lead to the political stabilisation and deeper unity needed to free the métropole."
natfra.51.a:0 "A new dawn for the nation."

natfra.52.t:0 "The Coronation"
natfra.52.d:0 "Today in Algiers, all the dreams of the Action Française and of French royalism were at last realised. In a long and elaborate ceremony, Jean d'Orléans was crowned King of France, with as many ancient rites and rituals as the circumstances of exile made possible. Notably, however, the new King did not swear, as his ancestors did, to fight infidels, owing to the AF's alliance with Arab groups, and the need to maintain the loyalty of the largely Muslim native population.\nAfter the coronation was fnished, Jean met in private with both Philippe Pétain and Charles Maurras, apparently discussing the future governance of France with the monarchy back in place."
natfra.52.a:0 "Vive le Roi!"

natfra.53.t:0 "The King's Cabinet"
natfra.53.d:0 "Today, after some days of political wrangling presided over by the King, a new government for the resurrected Kingdom was at last agreed. Philippe Pétain's previous role as Head of State has been made redundant by the monarchy, and he has instead accepted to become Minister of War, while Charles Maurras becomes Premier in his place, and prominent cabinet roles are filled by loyal AF men.\nIn practice, the message is clear: the military junta, which has dominated French politics since 1919, is no more. Although many saw this coming as Pétain became more and more dependent on Maurras to prop up his rule, such a sudden departure from power has nonetheless astonished many. However, by 1936 most Frenchmen had become disgruntled with military rule, not incorrectly seeing the junta as more and more corrupt and stagnant. Although Maurras is far from universally liked either, he has a strong and growing support base, and most of the country only hopes that he can do a better job than his predecessors."
natfra.53.a:0 "Maurras will lead the nation on to greatness!"

natfra.54.t:0 "The Purpose of the Camelots du Roi"
natfra.54.d:0 "Now that we have resolved to deepen the role of the Camelots du Roi within the government, we must settle on a clearer purpose for the movement. So far, under Maurice Pujo, the Camelots have formally been considered a youth group, but in practice have more closely resembled a political paramilitary, with young men in the organisation often engaging in street fights with members of opposing parties and protecting AF politicians. Many now believe that such an organisation is vital for the government to hold on to power, but others believe that reforming it into a genuine youth group would also be a succesful policy."
natfra.54.a:0 "We need the loyalty of the next generation: reform it into a youth movement."
natfra.54.b:0 "The opposition is still a threat, keep it as it is."

natfra.55.t:0 "Controlling the Streets"
natfra.55.d:0 "Since we formalised the Camelots du Roi's possition as a political paramilitary, the organisation has been indispensible in maintaining order around the country. In every major city, loyal Camelots can frquently be seen keeping watch on the streets, and have been vital in rounding up undesirables and dissidents, and impressing the strength of the new government on ordinary people. This assertion of government power has done much to stabilise our regime, greatly encouraging Pujo and the rest of the AF leadership."
natfra.55.a:0 "We salute their courage."

natfra.56.t:0 "Royalist Youth Camps"
natfra.56.d:0 "Over the past weeks, the Camelots du Roi have been reformed into a genuine youth movement, with their more paramilitary members re-assigned to the growing secret police, and boys around the country enrolled. Now, youth camps are opening around the country, funded and supported by the state. These institutions will teach the youth of the naton true moral values, alongside dedication to the King and rrespect for the hierarchies of soceity."
natfra.56.a:0 "An excellent initiative!"

natfra.57.t:0 "The Republican Intellectuals"
natfra.57.d:0 "As we consolidate power and restore the Orléans monarchy to its rightful place, we must deal with the philosophers, writers, political theorists, and other dubious "intellectuals" who were prominent supporters of the Republic. Although it goes without saying that their writings and theories must be suppressed, many in the government woudld also like to see these seiditious figures locked up, while others argue that they can do no harm by themselves, and leaving them be would avoid controversy."
natfra.57.a:0 "I want these pseudo-intellectuals behind bars!"
natfra.57.b:0 "They're not a threat if we stamp out their literature."

natfra.58.t:0 "The Fate of the Politicians"
natfra.58.d:0 "The Third Republuc was home to an extensive and burgeoning ruling class, and now, as we work to dismantle it, we must decide on its fate. Hardliners with the  goveernent righhtlly blame these men for the weakness and failings of the Repubic, and for promoting horrific decadence, but some moderates believe that, with their political parties dissolved and influence no more, they can be no threat to us, and that taking more action against them would only lead to condemnation."
natfra.58.a:0 "They're all corrupt scum, we can't take any chances."
natfra.58.b:0 "They aren't able to challenge us any more, leave them alone."

natfra.59.t:0 "The Future of Parliament"
natfra.59.d:0 "Opposition to parliamentary power, and to the parliamentarian establishment, has always been integral to Maurras's ideology. Now that we are in power, however, we need a practical solution to the problem of parliament, for which Maurras has received two proposals. The orthodox view within the AF is that the Assembly should be abolished outright, though some believe that it would now be more politically expedient to reduce it to an advisory body, devoid of much power but useful to maintain confidence in the government."
natfra.59.a:0 "We have no need for such a worthless body."
natfra.59.b:0 "They'll do fine as an advisory institution."

natfra.60.t:0 "A Classical Curriculum"
natfra.60.d:0 "With Maurras's government having commited to promote a revival of classical culture and ideals, it is essential that the youth learn these principles. As such, a new education law has been passed, establishing a new curriculum for students in France. From now on, classical languages, philosophy, and history will be greatly elevated in the curriculum, and become compulsory for every child. By instilling in the youth the values of the ancient world, we will doubtless restore its greatness."
natfra.60.a:0 "There is nothing better to learn."

natfra.61.t:0 "The Future of Immigration"
natfra.61.d:0 "The Action Française has always staunvhly opposed immigration, identifying unassimilated immigrants, or, in Athenian terminology, "metics" as one of the "four confederated estates" of the Anti-France. However, the party is now divided over how exactly to solve the problem of immigration. One proposal, inspired by Maurras's emphasis on Mediterranean civilisation, is to restrict immigration to those from Latin countries. On the other hand, some within the government believe we should ignore national origin, provided that all immigrants are made to assimilate into French culture and only small numbers are taken in. Others, meanwhile, want to end immigration outright"
natfra.61.a:0 "Limit it to Latin countries."
natfra.61.b:0 "Managed numbers and assimilation will do fine."
natfra.61.c:0 "End it entirely."

natfra.62.t:0 "The Fate of Protestant Missionaries"
natfra.62.d:0 "Protestantism, the religion of the German filth and an affront to the essentially Latin hierarchies of the Catholic Church, has long been identified as a key part of the Anti-France by Maurras. Thankfully, the African territories have no substantial Protestant population which could threaten our government, but there are nonetheless many Protestant missionaries, especially in the Sub-Saharan colonies. Although many want us to stamp out these seditious preachers lest they turn the natives against us, many of the missionaries are Anglicans supported by our English and Canadian allies, so some are urging us to pragmatically leave them be, lest the Entente Cordiale is strained unduely."
natfra.62.a:0 "Leave them alone, we should avoid upsetting the Canadians."
natfra.62.b:0 "The Canadians need our ships and troops more than a few Priests."

natfra.63.t:0 "Combatting Freemasonry"
natfra.63.d:0 "Freemasonry, as a highly secretive international network which stands opposed to the Classical ideals of the Action Française, has aways drawn the party's ire, and is identified by Maurras as one of the four estates of the Anti-France. It goes without saying that the time has come to shut down the Masonic lodges around our territory, and to ban the practice.\nMany of course would like to go further still, and take this opportunity to round up known Freemasons, as well as uncovering those who have kept their affiliations hidden: many have associated with or supported liberal movements, and with Masonry banned none of them will sympathise with us now. Others, however, argue that such an operation would be extremely costly, and it's always possible that we could simply fail to find much evidence against them."
natfra.63.a:0 "Banning Masonic activity from now on will be enough."
natfra.63.b:0 "We can take no chances: round up known Masons and expose the others."

natfra.64.t:0 "The Crémieux Decree Repealed"
natfra.64.d:0 "Now that we have largely dealt with France's other enemies, we can turn to what many view as the most insidious of all her foes: the Jews. The Action Française came into being amidst the Dreyfus Affair, and Maurras's ideology has always criticised their influence over France. In Algeria, meanwhile, all Jews have been French citizens for decades now, something that has consistently drawn anger and resentment from the natives.\nBut no more: today, His Majesty formally repealed the Crémieux Decree, which first granted citizenship to the Jews of Algeria. Natives around the country have celebrated the news, and Maurras's allies in Ferhat Abbas's AF-inspired Action Algerienne have congratulated the government, and promised to reedouble their efforts to improve co-operation betweem Arabs and Frenchmen."
natfra.64.a:0 "Excellent news!"

natfra.65.t:0 "Aristocratic Restorations"
natfra.65.d:0 "The French aristocracy, in spite of its long and proud history, has long been humiliated and repressed by the Republic. However, this can go on no longer: the aristocracy has a vital role to play within Maurras's ideal of an orderly, hierarchical society, and French aristocrats are almost universally monarchist, and generally sympathetic to the AF. As such, the government has set about restoring legal recognition of aristocratic titles, and with it restoring the French peerage, to ensure a loyal and organic government."
natfra.65.a:0 "Let the nobility resume its good work for the nation!"

natfra.66.t:0 "Pogroms in Algiers"
natfra.66.d:0 "In the aftermath of the repeal of the Crémieux Decree, anti-Semitic sentiment has been galvanised in Algeria, both among Arab nationalists who have long resented the special treatment of Jews and Frenchmen sympathetic to Maurras's rhetoric.\nAlthough most Jews are now leaving the country, for Germany, Palestine, or even the Commune, those that are stayed are increasingly being attacked, with anti-Jewish demonstrations increasingly common. These are now descending into violence, something that most integralists have little objection to, and thus many believe the government should endorse the demonstrations. However, some in the government are worried about international condemnation, and thus urge us to reign in the demonstrators before it grows out of hand."
natfra.66.a:0 "Their complaints are justified: encourage them."
natfra.66.b:0 "Put a lid on it now before it becomes embarassing."

natfra.67.t:0 "Breaking up High Finance"
natfra.67.d:0 "For too long, the rootless and corrupt agents of global finance have sought to enslave people around the world, separating them from faith, culture, and tradition. Now, however, we can begin to put a stop to this: today, by order of the King, the assets of countless prominent banks and non-French businessmen were seized.\nNow that the state is in control of their wealth and businesses, we must decide what to do with them. Some believe that we should redistribute it to loyal Frenchmen, while others argue that to prevent another spiral into corruption, the state must maintain control over these businesses, and can spend the money on new projects."
natfra.67.a:0 "Give it to patriotic Frenchmen."
natfra.67.b:0 "Maintain state control."

natfra.68.t:0 "Supporting Native Elites"
natfra.68.d:0 "In order to entrench acceptance of French rule, the government has moved to extend Maurras's ideals of localism and decentralised government to Africa, consolidating the longstanding alliance between French colonial rule and native monarchs and chiefs. As such, we must find a place for these native leaders.\nSome within the government believe that it would be fitting to make them Peers of the Realm, on an equal footing to French aristocrats, while others believe it would be better to give them nominal self-governance over their lands, on the condition of loyalty to the French Crown."
natfra.68.a:0 "Make them French noblemen within the Kingdom."
natfra.68.b:0 "Give them autonomy in exchange for loyalty to France."

natfra.69.t:0 "An Offer from de Gaulle"
natfra.69.d:0 "General Charles de Gaulle, despite not being an active supporter of the Action Française, has nevertheless had monarchist sympathies for some time, seeing a King as a positive figure for national unity, and has also had some admiration of Maurras. As such, he was notable in his enthusiasm at the Restoration, and has been instrumental in encouraging his colleagues in the army, particularly his mentor, Pétain, to accept the new state of affairs.\nNow, de Gaulle has reached out to the AF, asking that, in his capacity as Chief of Staff, he be given increased powers to control the Armed Forces, and be further included in government decisions on national defence, foreign policy, and military spending, in practice bringing him into the Cabinet.\nMost of the AF is pleased at his sympathies for the government, and is enthusiastic at the idea, though others argue that he deviates too far from the party's ideology to be trusted."
natfra.69.a:0 "Bring him into the government, we need allies."
natfra.69.b:0 "We can do without moderates in powerful positions."

natfra.70.t:0 "Winning Over the Church"
natfra.70.d:0 "With the Action Française having greatly consolidated its position as the French government, one last major obstacle remains: the Catholic Church. Although Catholic conservatives have historically been supportive of French monarchism, and the AF's rhetoric has favoured State Catholicism, relations with the Church have been regrettably strained by the fact that Maurras, and many other prominent figures in the AF, are agnostic. Maurras's support for State Catholicism, meanwhile, comes from his admiration for the Church's hierarchy, which he sees as embodying the hierarchies of Latin civilisation, and his belief that shared Catholicism would help hold France together.\nThis has always been percieved as opportunistic and cynical by the Church, and, although the anti-Clerical policies of the Commune have caused the Papacy to restrain itself from openly condemning the AF, the Church has little love for our government, and has beeen greatly reluctant to support us after our coming to power.\nOf course, this situation must be remedied, something for which we have recieved three proposals. Many believe that if Maurras and others could convert to Caholicism, and renounce their earlier disparaging comments about Christianity, the Church will be placated. On the other hand, many believe that an offer to defend the Church from the syndicalist menace would bring them around. Others, meanwhile, argue that we should simply remind the Church of the Commune's anti-clericalism, and of our support fot State Catholicism, opportunistic or otherwise, to present ourselves as a lesser evil."
natfra.70.a:0 "If Maurras joins the Church, they'll have nothing to complain about."
natfra.70.b:0 "An offer to defend the Papacy can hardly be refused."
natfra.70.c:0 "Remind the Church that the Communards will be worse than us."

natfra.71.t:0 "Charles Maurras Joins the Church"
natfra.71.d:0 "Although the Catholic Church has historically been sympathetic to French monarchism, relations with the reborn Kingdom have been deeply strained, due to the fact that the Church has long had poor relations with the Action Française. This is because its leader, Charles Maurras, is himself an agnostic, and the party's support for State Catholicism is more because Maurras admires the Church for its hierarchy than because of any faith in God.\nNow, however, in what seems to be a bid to win over the Church, Maurras has converted to Roman Catholicism. This goes a long way to placating our prior worries about the AF, and many now believe that we should improve relations with the French exiles, and work towards signing a new Concordat."
natfra.71.a:0 "Very well, let's reach out to the French."
natfra.71.b:0 "Maurras's conversion is as opportunistic as his earlier writings."

natfra.72.t:0 "An Offer from the French"
natfra.72.d:0 "Although the Catholic Church has historically been sympathetic to French monarchism, relations with the reborn Kingdom have been deeply strained, due to the fact that the Church has long had poor relations with the Action Française. This is because its leader, Charles Maurras, is himself an agnostic, and the party's support for State Catholicism is more because Maurras admires the Church for its hierarchy than because of any faith in God.\nNow, however, in what seems to be a bid to win over the Church, French diplomats have contacted us with an offer to protect us from the Italian socialists, in exchange for the Church softening its relations with the AF and working towards a concordat. Although many believe that this would be a betrayal of our principles, the dominant view in the Church is that Maurras is by far a lesser evil compared to the Syndicalists, and that State Catholicism, even if the reasons for it are opportunistic, is far better than socialist anti-clericalism."
natfra.72.a:0 "Very well, let's reach out to the French."
natfra.72.b:0 "We can't sell out like this."

natfra.73.t:0 "An Message from the French"
natfra.73.d:0 "Although the Catholic Church has historically been sympathetic to French monarchism, relations with the reborn Kingdom have been deeply strained, due to the fact that the Church has long had poor relations with the Action Française. This is because its leader, Charles Maurras, is himself an agnostic, and the party's support for State Catholicism is more because Maurras admires the Church for its hierarchy than because of any faith in God.\nNow, however, in what seems to be a bid to win over the Church, French diplomats have contacted us, stating that they are aware of and understand the Church's concerns about the Maurras government, but that the blatant anti-clericalism of the Commune would be far worse, and it is in the interests of the Church and of French Catholics that we soften relations with the AF, and work towards signing a concordat. Although some are sypathetic to this message, many believe that accepting the AF's suggestions would be a betrayal of the Church's principles, especially given that the AF has not offered to do anything in exchange."
natfra.73.a:0 "They're a lesser evil compared to the Commune, we should reach out to them."
natfra.73.b:0 "We can't trust Maurras."

natfra.74.t:0 "The Church Accepts"
natfra.74.d:0 "Excellent news has reached Algiers today, as the Holy See has accepted our diplomatic advances, and announced its intention to sign a Concordat with the government of the Kingdom. It seems that what concessions we offered them have paid off, and that they have accepted the fact that we are far better for French Catholics than the Communards ever could be. This will greatly strengthen the hand of the government, as many conservative Catholics once skeptical about the AF will come around to us."
natfra.74.a:0 "Brilliant!"

natfra.75.t:0 "The Church Refuses"
natfra.75.d:0 "Disappointing news has reached Algiers today, as the Holy See has refused our diplomatic advances, seemingly unimpressed by the fact that we would be a better government for French Catholics than the atheistic Commune, and not interested in the concessions we offered. This may greatly weaken the AF government in the long term, as the support conservative Catholics will be even further out of reach, and many of our political allies in the military or other monarchist groups, and even the royal family themselves, may lose confidence in the government."
natfra.75.a:0 "A disaster!"

natfra.76.t:0 "An Offer From Deloncle"
nfa.76.d:0 "With more moderate royalist sympathisers such as de Gaulle increasingly sidelined, we have been approached with a new offer of collaboration from Eugène Deloncle, a former member of the Action Française who became disillusioned with Maurras's inaction in the years before we came to power, and who grew more sympathetic to newer nationalist ideals prevalent in Italy, Romania, Russia, and elsewhere.\nNow, however, Deloncle appears enthusiastic at the death of the republic and restoration of the monarchy, and, in spite of his differences, is willing to work with our government.\nHe does indeed appear to have a lot to offer us: he seemingly has contacts throughout the military and intelligence services, and many likeminded loyalists willing to aid him. In exchange for some political influence and concessions, Deloncle claims, he will be able to use his connections to pacify what remains of the opposition, and even infiltrate the Commune."
natfra.76.a:0 "He could be a valuable ally, give him the go-ahead."
natfra.76.b:0 "We can't trust this terrorist."

natfra.77.t:0 "The Colonel's Coalition"
natfra.77.d:0 "Having been appointed Premier by Maréchal Pétain to restore confidence in the regime and rebuild popular support, François de la Rocque now needs to find political allies, if he is to have any chance of consolidating power. As such, he today announced on the steps of the Assembly that he and his cabinet would work towards forming a new government of national unity, intended to bridge political divides and reunite the nation, alongside an anti-corruption push.\nIt is expected that this initiative will be supported by Pétain's other allies in parliament, such as Louis Marin's Fédération Républicain, and many have pinned their hopes for a restoration of order and unity onto de la Rocque. President Pétain as well is said to have high hopes for his new premier, though some of his loyalists worry that de la Rocque's power and popularity is eclipsing Pétain's own, and that his political maneouverings lack presidential oversight."
natfra.77.a:0 "We'll need to find allies..."

natfra.78.t:0 "Marin Joins the Unity Government"
natfra.78.d:0 "After many smaller nationalist and conservative parties and independents pledged their support of de la Rocque's unity government, today Louis Marin, leader of the conservative and Catholic, but avwoedly republican, Fédération Républicain, did the same, assuring de la Rocque of the support of his party. Although Marin himself hopes to amass influence for himself and his party within de la Rocque's government, many predict that his alliance with the Croix-de-Feu will simply see his movement absorbed and eclipsed."
natfra.78.a:0 "Only time will tell."

natfra.79.t:0 "The Special Premieral Powers Act"
natfra.79.d:0 "With de la Rocque's unity government having absorbed the smaller rightwing parties, the Fédératon Républicain, and many delegates from the Alliance Démocratique, there was little opposition today when he passed through the Assemvly a new Special Premieral Powers Act. The Act expands on the State of Emergency declared by Foch in 1919, giving the Premier special powers to enforce the State of Emergency and to maintain order.\nIn practice, this has concentrated extraordinary power in de la Rocque, and it is clearly him, not Pétain or anybody else, who is in control. The nation only waits to see what he will do with his newfound control over the state."
natfra.79.a:0 "We can trust the Colonel."

natfra.80.d.degaulle:0 "Over the past months, the acceptance of Charles de Gaulle's proposals for military reform has propelled him to a position of great influence within Pétain's clique, and, by extension, within the government. As such, it is vital to secure his loyalty.\nWith this in mind, de la Rocuqe today met with the General, his fellow Great War veteran, and a man who shares many of his Catholic and nationalistic beliefs, in spite of de Gaulle's past sympathies for monarchism.\nThe two men were able to find much common ground, and de Gaulle has agreed to support the civilianisation of the junta under the Croix-de-Feu, in exchange for greater investment in the army, and greater autonomy for the general staff."
natfra.80.d.darlan:0 "Over the past months, the acceptance of François Darlan's proposals for military reform has propelled him to a position of great influence within Pétain's clique, and, by extension, within the government. As such, it is vital to secure his loyalty.\nWith this in mind, de la Rocuqe today met with the Admiral, his fellow Great War veteran, whose rapid rise through the French navy during the 1920s and 1930s, and involvment with Pétain, has caused him to develop nationalistic and anti-parliamentarian ideas shared by de la Rocque.\nThe two men were able to find much common ground, and Darlan has agreed to support the civilianisation of the junta under the Croix-de-Feu, in exchange for greater investment in the army, and greater autonomy for the general staff."
natfra.80.a:0 "We would be nothing without the heroes of the military."

natfra.81.t:0 "Our Friends in Business"
natfra.81.d:0 "Throughout the Croix-de-Feu's history, the party has been supported by many patriotic and right-leaning businessman, and in its early days the party depended entirely on financial support from the succesful perfumer François Coty. De la Rocque has always maintained good relations with the business community since, and Coty for his part has already been rewarded with the post of Minister of Finance.\nHowever, de la Rocque has many backers beyond Coty himself, and they all want something in return for their donations and support. De la Rocque is of course grateful for their contributions, and is eager to repay them somehow, but many of his advisers, and the remaining military men in the government, believe that bringing loyal businessmen into the government en masse would likely be seen as corrupt."
natfra.81.a:0 "Their loyalty has been essential: reward them with government positions."
natfra.81.b:0 "We don't want to be seen as corrupt, just favour them for contracts."

natfra.82.t:0 "Allegations of Corruption"
natfra.82.d:0 "Over the past months, several wealthy businessmen have recieved notable government posts, something that has not gone unnoticed. The remaining newspapers that have submitted to neither us nor the old junta have printed embarrassing details of longstanding Croix-de-Feu supporters being given favourable contracts and government jobs, while other businessmen are overlooked.\nDe la Rocque's allies in the business community, whose reputations have been harmed even more than de la Rocque's, are urging the Colonel to stamp out the dissent now, before we have to deal with a repeat of the earlier protests.\nOn the other hand, many of the Colonel's allies in the party and military believe that it would be more effective and sustainable to launch anti-corruption campaings, restoring public confidence in the regime, and  preventing us from growing too dependent on big business."
natfra.82.a:0 "Crush the rumours before this becomes an issue."

Although François Coty has continued to do well, and remains influential in his post as Finance Minister, he has grown frustrated by the treatment of his fellow businessmen and political allies, and is now demanding greater concessions to big business.\nMany of de la Rocque's allies believe that we should accept Coty's demands without guaranteeing as many concessions as he might have wanted earlier, but others argue that by continuing to reject his and his allies' advances, we can finally break free from the influence of big business."

natfra.84.d:0 "For years now, the Croix-de-Feu has staunchly opposed the influence of "hidden socialism", claiming the existence of a vast socialist conspiracy against the French nation and its leaders, and arguing that the Maréchal's government has been inflitrated and betrayed by Communard sympathisers.\nNow, on the back of the Special Premieral Powers Act, Colonel de la Rocque today pushed through the Assembly, with the support of a clear majority, the Special Counter-Socialist Measures Act, giving the government and Deuxieme Bureau extensive powers to investigate and crush syndicalist infiltration.\nWith the valiant officers of the law already setting to work cracking down on socialist spies and their Arab nationalist puppets, the nation will be made secure in no time."
natfra.84.a:0 "Justice will be served."

natfra.85.t:0 "The Radicaux Exposed"
natfra.85.d:0 "Today, a shocking truth came to light, thanks to the determined work of the Deuxieme Bureau. The Parti Radical, supposedly a safe and well-intentioned Republican party, has been thoroughly infiltrated by Communard agents ever since the exile.\It has always been well-known that the Party splintered at the tie of the revolution, with its left wing staying on in the Commune, but what has been kept hidden up to now is that the party leadership has maintained contacts with their former colleagues in the métropole ever since. The security implications of this are, of course, horrendous, and the pa's leadership is being rounded up and questioned, with both Cammille Chautemps and Édouard Daladier already behind bars and their party soon to be dissolved.\nAs we seek to pick up the pieces of this shocking revelation, we can only hope that their co-conspirators are soon found and dealt with."
natfra.85.a:0 "Ban this insidious party!"

natfra.86.t:0 "Dealing with the Action Française"
natfra.86.d:0 "As we continue to investigate Communard infiltration, the plot has only thickened, and it appears that the right has been as thoroughly manipulated as the left.\nGeorges Valois and his Cercle Proudhon were close to the Action Française, and to Charles Maurras himself, before the revolution, and it appears that they never really fell out, with many AF men found to have maintained contacts with members of Valois's "Sorelian" movement in the Commune, allowing sensitive information to reach the reds in Paris.\nMaurras, Pujo, and several other prominent AF politicians have been rounded up by the police, and the party's membership is ouraged at their leaders' treachery, and will likely now turn to the Croix-de-Feu itself as the true party of French nationalism."
natfra.86.a:0 "I want these traitors behind bars!"

natfra.87.t:0 "The Whole Truth"
natfra.87.d:0 "As politicians and parties across the political spectrum have been investigated and exposed for their connections to the Commune, it has become clear that some malicious individuals must have co-ordinated and covered up these efforts. Given how long this infiltrationhas gone on for, such individuals can only be exceptionally high-up in the government.\nAs such, countless longstanding aides and advisors to Phillipe Pétain have been rounded up, and are currently under investigation as we seek to find the Communard agents among them.\nIn practice, this has left Pétain cut off from many of his nominal loyalists. The Maréchal's public appearances have lately declined anyway, and with de la Rocque having forged his own alliances with the army, and in control of the Assmebly, many now wonder how much power Pétain really has."
natfra.87.a:0 "De la Rocque will save the nation from these saboteurs!"

natfra.88.t:0 "An Arab Wing"
natfra.88.d:0 "As we seek to further expand the mass party of the Croix-de-Feu, a proposal has reached de la Rocque that we create a new wing of the party, to represent the Arab population in Algeria. Especially as we attack the Action Française, which had some sympathy among the natives, and as we only tighten the taxation and conscription of Algerians in anticipation of the liberation, many believe it would be politically expedient to win their loyalty, though others argue that it would be a waste of funfs, and in practice largely futile."
natfra.88.a:0 "We need the Algerians' support, go ahead."
natfra.88.b:0 "We can't spare the money for this endeavour."

natfra.89.t:0 "Incentivising Party Membership"
natfra.89.d:0 "As the government seeks to bolster membership of the Croix-de-Feu, it will be essential to ensure that party memberhsip is common among civil servants, and other government employees. One proposal to encourage membership is to give party members subtle pay rises, and to make this practice an open secret, inspiring people to join. On the other hand, it has been suggested that party members could be favoured for promotions, and for government jobs in the first place. Meanwhile, we could also simply make mebership a legal requirement, though this would likely cause some controversy."
natfra.89.a:0 "Increase the salary of known mebers."
natfra.89.b:0 "Give members better opportunities for promotions and employment."
natfra.89.c:0 "Make membership mandatory."

natfra.90.t:0 "Enshrining Corporatism"
natfra.90.d:0 "Colonel de la Rocque, with the backing of all that remains of the Assembly, and the acceptance of the increasingly isolated Maréchal, has now commited to creating a new constitution for the French nation, to better organise it for the liberation and beyond.\nThe first step in establishing the new legal framework for the Colonel's state has, to the surprise of few, been the official establishment of a Corporatist system of government.\nThe first part of the constitution to be agreed on and ratified by the government has established a system of collective management of businesses, with unions controlled by the state, and the representation of unions and government officials on company boards, to ensure fait and collective management of industry."
natfra.90.a:0 "This will ensure stability better than any market or revolution."

natfra.91.t:0 "The Presidential State"
natfra.91.d:0 "As the drafting of the constitution continues, the government has now agreed upon the system of government that it will enshrine: a Catholic and Presidential republic.\nEver since Foch took over the government in 1919, the Republic has seen governmental power concentrated in the Presidency, but so far Pétain has had to operate through unofficial or pseudo-legal means.\nHowever, some wonder if he will ever make use of these new and extensive powers: the old Maréchal's public appearances have grown more and more infrequent, and he seems to have little to no influence on the drafting of what is being widely called the "Colonel's Constitution"."
natfra.91.a:0 "Only strong leadership can save France."

natfra.92.t:0 "A Social Republic"
natfra.92.d:0 "Today, by a unanimous vote of the Assembly, the new Constitution of the newly-christened République Sociale Française was adopted, and signed into law by President Pétain. The constitution formally adopts the conservative, Catholic, and corporatist agenda of the Croix-de-Feu, creating a Presidential corporate state.\nHowever, far from stregnthening the current President, this constitution has finally brought his political career to an end. After ratifying the constitution, Maréchal Pétain cofirmed that he was retiring from political and military life, to the unanimous applause and gratitude of the Assembly.\nIt had been no secret that de la Rocque had gradually stripped away Pétain's influence since becoming Premier, but the retirement of the man who has dominated French politics since 1929 has still come as a surprise to many, though most of the population hopes that fresh leaderhsip will strengthen the country.\nFrançois de la Rocque was soon declared Pétain's succesor as President, and in a long and succesful speech vowed to do his upmost to liberate France."
natfra.92.a:0 "Adieu Pétain, et Bienvenue de la Rocque!"

natfra.93.t:0 "The Old Union Officials"
natfra.93.d:0 "Now that the government has assumed control over the trade unions and re-organised them into the CSPF, we must decide what to do with the officials of the old independent trade unions. Although we cannot deny their organisational skill and experience, these men were largely aligned with the Parti Radical or Parti Républicain-Socialiste, both of which have long had poor relations with de la Rocque.\nAs such,we must decide what to do with these men. Some believe that they should be given jobs equivalent to their old positions in exchange for loyalty, while others believe that we should tightly vet them. Others, meanwhile, argue that we should simply get rid of them all."
natfra.93.a:0 "Let them stay on if they swear loyalty."
natfra.93.b:0 "Tightly vet them for socialist sympathies."
natfra.93.c:0 "We can't trust any of them."

natfra.94.t:0 "What to do with Pétain?"
natfra.94.d:0 "Over a month has passed since Pétain, having seen his political influence slowly swept away from under his feet, resigned the Presidency to make way for de la Rocque. The Maréchal has stayed on in his military post since then, but has now informed the government of his intention to also retire from military life, though he hopes to continue his career in some form. We could keep him busy by giving him a diplomatic posting, or make him a parliamentarian (a largely ceremonial role since the new constituion concentrated power in the presidency). On the other hand, some believe it would be more advantageous if Pétain fully retired."
natfra.94.a:0 "He'll do fine as a senator."
natfra.94.b:0 "Make him our ambassador in Ottawa."
natfra.94.c:0 "Pressure him to retire entirely."

natfra.95.t:0 "A New Concordat"
natfra.95.d:0 "Ever since 1789, France's relations with the Catholic Church have frequently been strained, with successive governments attacking Catholicism. This only grew worse in 1905, when the republican government broke all ties with the Church.\nToday, however, this was set right, and François de la Rocque, having arrived in Rome the day before, signed a new Concordat with the Catholic Church, restoring Roman Catholicism as the state religion of France. De la Rocque has been congratulated for this by the Pope, and the Croix-de-Feu, always the party of the Catholic right, will likely be greatly strenghtened."
natfra.95.a:0 "Excellent news!"

natfra.96.t:0 "Anti-Semitism in the Croix-de-Feu"
natfra.96.d:0 "As the Croix-de-Feu expands, we must address the question of anti-semitism among the party membership. Although de la Rocque has condemned anti-semitism in the past, and has good relations with the Chief Rabbi Jakob Kaplan, he has also been known to condemn Jewish immigration into the African territories, and has opposed the settlement in Algeria of Jewish refugees.\nMeanwhile, the Croix-de-Feu, as a nationalist mass movement, has inevitably attracted many members with anti-semitic dispositions, and as such party members are growing increasingly divided on the matter of anti-semitism.\nDe la Rocque is thus being urged by many moderates to condemn anti-semitism again, though others believe that this would hinder our efforts to absorb former Action Française supporters."
natfra.96.a:0 "We can't risk angering the radical right."
natfra.96.b:0 "We need to take a stance against these un-French sentiments."

natfra.97.t:0 "Opposition to Female Suffrage"
natfra.97.d:0 "Our recent move towards implementing female suffrage fulfills a longstanding goal of the French right, which has long supported giving women the vote, as they are seen as modest and pious, making them ideal Catholic conservative voters.\nHowever, this has also garnered much opposition, with some claiming that we are doing it only to bolster our share of the vote, even though elections are no longer worth much, and many others arguing that women simply do not have the political experience and social responsibility needed to have equal political power to men."
natfra.97.a:0 "Their complaints mean nothing."

natfra.98.t:0 "Promoting Le Flambeau"
natfra.98.d:0 "Le Flambeau has been the official newspaper of the Croix-de-Feu for several years now, loyally supporting the message of Colonel de la Rocque. However, it is of course only read by our loyal supporters, so it currently serves little use as a propaganda outlet.\nWith this in mind, two different solutions have been proposed to bolster the paper's circulation. First, we could use govent funding to drive down its price, making it too cheap for independent newspapers to compete with. On the other hand, we could subsidise shops that sell the paper and promote it in their own ways."
natfra.98.a:0 "Drive down its price with government money."
natfra.98.b:0 "Give shops subsidies for selling it."

natfra.99.t:0 "Leisure for the People"
natfra.99.d:0 "Providing for quality popular leisure activities has long been a key policy of the Croix-de-Feu, and it today became a reality, with Colonel de la Rocque signing into law the creation of a new National People's Board for Leisure, which will supervise and arrange holidays, fitness activities, youth camps, and more besides, to reward the great people of France for their loyal service."
natfra.99.b:0 "A brilliant initiative."

natfra.100.t:0 "Le Petit Journal Purchased"
natfra.100.d:0 "On the top of our efforts to further popularise Le Flambeau, the Croix-de-Feu today purchased the longstanding and prestigious conservative newspaper Le Petit Journal. The newspaper, which is over 60 years older than our party, has a wide audience and is broadly resoected, making it an ideal mouthpiece for the government's agenda and its message to the public."
natfra.100.b:0 "The people will be better informed than ever!"

natfra.101.t:0 "Le Redressement Français"
natfra.101.d:0 "As we further solidify the corporate state, we have been approached by an organisation called the Redressment Français, or French Renewal. Founded by the succesful businessman Ernest Mercier on the advice of President Foch during the 1920s, the Redressement seeks to operate as a combination of a think tank and social club for prominent businessmen, promoting a pro-business view of corporatism alongside a traditionalist social agenda. Mercier has assured de la Rocque of his loyalty, and, citing their many shared ideals, has promised to do his best to round up support for the government among his associates."
natfra.101.b:0 "A worthy ally."

natfra.102.t:0 "The CSPF Established"
natfra.102.d:0 "Today, a special act promulgated by the rump assembly confirmed by de la Rocque has brought into being the Confédération des Syndicats Professionnels Français, or French Confederation of Professional Unions. This new government entity will absorb all currently existing trade unions, bringing them under government supervison, with each profession represented by a state union within the Confederation.Under Roger Vitrac, the organisayion will surely strenghten our support among ordinary workers, and ensure the representation of the common man."
natfra.102.b:0 "A vital component of the corporate state."

natfra.103.t:0 "Marin Retires"
natfra.103.d:0 "Today, in a lengthy speech in the Assembly, Louis Marin, leader of the Fédération Républicain, announced his full retirement from public life. Marin has led a long and succesful career, leading the conservative FR for many years, and loyally supporting both the junta and now de la Rocque.\nHowever, under de la Rocque's unity government, he has seen much of his influence taken away from him, and his support largely absorbed by the Croix-de-Feu, inspiring him to retire to reduce future tensions within the government.\nNevertheless, Marin announced his full confidence in Colonel de la Rocque, and thanked the government for all its service."
natfra.103.b:0 "We shall all miss his dedication to France."

Without a prearranged agreement coming to fruition during the war, each side staked claim to as much land as they could.

The conclusion of the Second Weltkrieg marked the end of the third Franco-German war in the last 80 years. Many saw the conference in Lyon as just another bundle of kindling to spark further hatred between the two nations, but they have been proven wrong. With the signing of the treaty, the new French government is recognized as the true successor to the government that was toppled during the French civil war following the first Weltkrieg.

They are pushing for a short term economic reparations deal to help us recover the losses we took.

In exchange, we will turn over the land of occupied France that we hold.\n\nIn contrast, more Hawkish members of the diplomatic party have pushed forward an ambitious reparations agreement for the French to agree too. They are seeking the same agreements as the moderates with the additional clause of an establishment of an extended border strip for our ally in Belgium. The region of Pas-de-Calais will be annexed into Belgium and the French must dismantle all the forts along our shared border.\n\nWhile making sure to keep any in-fighting hidden from the French, the diplomatic envoys must decide whether to put forward the more reasonable request of the moderates that are likely to be accepted or to push their luck and try to scrape more from France by demanding the hawk deal."

nfa.401.d:0 "Critical to the stability of the regime, the Society of the Missionaries of Africa is a Catholic society of apostolic life focusing on evangelism and education in Africa. Founded in 1868 in Algiers, they quickly became an integral part of colonial society, adapting to native customs, adopting the native dress, all the while accomplishing a tremendous amount of ethnographical and geographic research. They have been on the forefront of French initiatives on the continent, despite their sometimes strained relationship with an increasingly anticlerical republican government. They have become staunch advocates for the native populations, even accepting native priests, never hesitating to side with them against the colonial authorities when needed and generally acting as a bridge between the two, earning them the affectionate nickname of \"White Fathers\".\n\nIn the troubled times since the revolution, they have become downright crucial to maintaining French authority over what is left of the empire, working tirelessly to maintain the peace between colonists, exiles, and natives with the full support of the Marshal’s conservative government."

nfa.402.t:0 "Action Algérienne"
nfa.402.d:0 "Founded in the ’20s by Ferhat Abbas in the chaos of the exile, calling itself the principal media outlet of integral nationalism alongside the main Action Française, Action Algérienne has become one of the most popular newspapers within the Algerian departments. Its slogan, \"From Colony to Province\", summarises its fight alongside integralist principles: assimilation within a greater France, while still retaining privileges, traditions and local laws against the centralisation and disregard for indigenous customs of the Republic. Demanding native autonomy in social and economic regulation, universal suffrage in municipal elections, and for native notables to constitute an assembly advising the French government, Abbas has quickly found resonance among natives, particularly the assimilated elites and the influential indigenous chiefs, eager to defend their way of life against an ever-encroaching republican government.\n\nHowever, the localist proposals of the Action is not the only thing that has found resonance among natives: its antisemitic rhetoric is also proving popular. Legacy of the Crémieux Decree, a law that granted full French citizenship to the Jewish population of French Algeria but not to the Arab and Berber Muslim population, who remain to this day essentially second-class citizens, this wedge between communities that had lived together in relative peace for centuries has proven easy to exploit for the far right, as some groups and parties even promise to repeal the decree to gain support from natives, either out of genuine ideological convergence or simply out of pragmatism, as they know that nothing could be achieved without the support, or at least the neutrality, of the indigènes."

nfa.403.t:0 "Jacques Bainville"
nfa.403.d:0 "Jacques Bainville, born in 1879, renowned historian, journalist, and one of the founders of the Action Française, has died at 57 years old. Born in a staunchly republican family, he turned to monarchism not out of nostalgia, but out of reflection and comparison, considering the Republic to be unstable, fickle, and fundamentally incapable to compete with a stable and united Germany. A prolific writer, he ceaselessly exalted the French monarchy in his historical works and contributed to many newspapers, simultaneously literary critic and financial analyst. Fleeing to Algeria as the revolution broke out, he wrote in the chaotic aftermath a short book that quickly became immensely popular. Titled \"The Political Consequences of Peace\", Bainvillle exposes his thoughts on the peace treaty between the CGT and the Germans, stating that just like the Republic is the daughter of Bismarck, engineered to weaken France, the Commune is the daughter of Wilhelm II, created to rot France down to her very roots so that she might eventually be turned into little more than a vassal state in an inevitable coming war.\n\nThis thesis has become one of the pillars of the rhetoric of the AF, who tirelessly advocates for the fall of one daughter of the Boche so that France might be able to take on the other. Many in our nation are sensible to this kind of talk as anti-German sentiment has certainly not subsided one bit among exiles, and Bainville’s funeral procession was followed by thousands of mourners, with political companions, fellow writers and academicians and even members of the government attending his funeral mass. The Lion of Verdun himself put out a statement honouring the life and works of the historian now seen as a prophet by many."

nfa.404.t:0 "Immaculée-Conception de Ouagadougou"
nfa.404.d:0 "The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of Ouagadougou was consecrated today in the presence of [NFA.GetLeader], Governor of Haute-Volta Henri-Louis Joseph Chessé, and Joanny Thévenoud, the very influential apostolic vicar of the city of Ouagadougou, whom some whisper is the \"true governor\" of the colony. The first cathedral to be consecrated in the Sahel, the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception takes inspiration from both traditional African building techniques and Romanesque architecture. It stands as a powerful symbol of the success of missionary work within the French colonial empire and especially that of the Pères Blancs. It is also the crowning personal achievement of Monsignor Thénévoud, whose presence in the city has made an unrivalled impact. Arriving in the city in 1903, he immediately reached out to the local Mossi chiefs and got to work building schools, a seminary, developing the land, and implementing industry, slowly but surely making the mission the economic heart of the city, if not the whole region. Two years after his arrival, there were already more than a thousand catechumens under his supervision: the number of converts has grown exponentially since.\n\nAs for the rumours that he is the true governor of the colony, it is undeniable that through his personal charisma, experience, diplomatic skills and growing economic influence, Monsignor Thénévoud wields considerable influence, often acting as an intermediary between the colonial administration and traditional power structures. He has been an important and outspoken part of the administrative council of Haute-Volta for more than a decade now and was a severe critic of the Algiers regime's handling of the famines of the early 1930s and the revolts that followed. However, the apostolic vicar has always dismissed claims that true power in Haute-Volta lies with him, presenting himself as nothing more than a humble missionary blessed with some success, caring for his flock."

nfa.405.t:0 "Mother's Day"
nfa.405.d:0 "Ten years ago, the government instituted a heavy-handed natalist policy, which among many other measures included the creation of a special celebration for Mothers’ Day, and of a Medal of the French Family, awarded to good mothers of numerous families. Though the results of these policies are only just starting to be felt, Mothers’ Day has caught on as a truly popular celebration, is now widely celebrated in schools and homes across the nation to the delight of mothers everywhere, and it has become customary for children to bring home little gifts for their mothers, and for husbands to make sure this is a special day for wives and of course for their own mothers. In a speech broadcast on the radio today, [NFA.GetLeader] reminded women that \"Only you can give to future generations the taste for honest work, this sense of discipline, of modesty, of respect which makes healthy men and a strong nation. You are the source of our Christian civilisation, and our greatest hope for the future\", ensuring that the incredibly important role of women in society is reminded to all and given the respect it deserves."

nfa.406.t:0 "Humanisme Intégral"
nfa.406.d:0 "\"Integral Humanism. Temporal and spiritual problems of a new Christianity\", the recently published work of influential Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain has caused passionate debate among Catholics. A convert from Protestantism, once close to the Action Française despite not being a monarchist, mostly out of suspicion towards representative democracy and opposition to the anticlerical policies of the Third Republic, Maritain has drifted after the shock of the exile towards more moderate positions, closer to the personalist movement and Christian democracy. Rejecting both reaction and liberalism, secularism and intransigent political Catholicism, embracing humanism, arguing for human rights, the importance of family, pluralistic democracy and responsibility toward the common good, all in the spirit of the social teachings of the Church, the philosopher is somewhat going against the grain. Indeed, much of the French Catholic laity and hierarchy has been radicalised by the current situation: the AF has even denounced \"Integral Humanism\" as the work of a traitor, a sell-out to \"democratism\", a red saboteur. However among more progressive Catholics Maritain’s work was very well received, getting praise from Father Montini, a close advisor of the pope, and with some moderates even being drawn away from the Action Française, heeding his warning that the movement is merely using the Faith as a tool to further their political ideology."
nfa.406.a:0 "A new kind of integralism, huh?"

nfa.407.t:0 "The Call of Silence"
nfa.407.d:0 "The Grand Prix du cinéma français has been awarded to \"The Call of Silence\", a drama by Léon Poirier. The movie, retelling the life of Blessed Charles de Foucauld, had found critical acclaim and great commercial success: indeed, he has fascinated the French public for years now. Charles Eugène, viscount de Foucauld would have seemed for much of his early life an unlikely candidate for the devotion now surrounding him. Born into an aristocratic family, he lived a dissolute life, eventually becoming a cavalry officer. This experience spurred him to leave his old life behind: he decided to take the vows, attracted by an ascetic life of poverty among the Tuaregs with whom he formed deep bonds, learning their language, translating the Scriptures, and preaching through example. Seen as a saintly man by natives, authorities and the Church’s hierarchy, a tragic end awaited him: caught in the conflict with the Senussi, he was martyred on the 1st of December 1916.\n\nDesert hermit, saintly martyr, pioneer of French influence in the most remote corners of the empire, Father Charles became a national icon, his total abandonment to God and asceticism inspiring many Catholics, leading some to rethink their positions on native populations and Islam as a whole. His recent beatification has even led the Academy of Colonial Sciences to petition the papacy so that he be made patron saint of colonisation: the regime, however, hasn’t waited for him to be officially recognised as such, and prominently uses him as a propaganda piece, despite de Foucauld’s frequent criticism of colonial attitudes."

nfa.408.t:0 "Sette Giugno Commemorations"
nfa.408.d:0 "On June 7 1919, riots broke out in Valletta, capital of the then British crown colony of Malta. Tensions with the British authorities had brewed for some time and the heavy burden of the Weltkrieg on the fortress island, as well as rising food prices, proved too much for thousands who ransacked locations associated with the British: when they attempted to force entry into a government building, soldiers opened fire. The crowd dispersed, and four laid dead. Ever since this grim day, it has been commemorated by the Maltese. As the British revolution came to a close in 1926, local authorities became increasingly nervous for the future of Malta, with mutiny, nationalist and socialist agitation, or occupation by another power seeming like increasingly real threats: the Germans being already in the process of seizing much of the empire would certainly not pass up an opportunity to spread their influence to the Mittelmeer. As such, the governor, Sir Walter Norris Congreve, called on us to secure the islands for the Entente, and French marine infantry obliged. Malta was granted much autonomy in dealing with day to day matters, officially still part of the British Empire but by now effectively a French protectorate, a state of affairs acceptable to both the small British elite content with maintaining their power and nationalists now enjoying something approaching home rule. As such, the Sette Giugno was made an official holiday of remembrance and hope for unity. Though no longer the headquarter of the Mediterranean fleet, the island is still the lock of the Strait of the Sicily, the bastion assuring Entente dominance over the Western Mediterranean: a large garrison is maintained on the island and much was invested to expand the defences and ports of the islands, reflecting its critical role in our naval strategy."

nfa.409.t:0 "News from Corsica"
nfa.409.d:0 "This morning, a war memorial containing soil from the mainland was inaugurated on a beach near Ajaccio. It was dedicated to the tens of thousands of Corsicans who gave their lives for France during the Weltkrieg and subsequent civil war. Since the revolution, the island has been an incredibly important bastion for us: indeed, it is so close from the Commune that its shores can be seen on a clear day, while Red Italy is less than 40 kilometres away. As such it has become a focal point for the Mediterranean strategy of the Entente, having quickly been transformed into a major naval and airbase from which our ships patrol as close as possible to the mainland, with tense face-offs with Internationale ships occurring every other week.\n\nAny liberation effort would have to start here, and much of the intelligence and reconnaissance work done in France and Italy is coordinated from Bastia and Ajaccio. It is also there that the first waves of exiles landed, and though most moved on to Algeria, many stayed, creating a population and economic boost that paired with the military build-up has revitalised the island, despite perpetual tension as war looms. Though there is no longer a stream of refugees like in the early days of the Commune, there is still a constant trickle of dissidents making their way to our shores, each given a hero’s welcome but carefully interrogated. Finally, organised crime, already an issue before the war, has become a mainstay of island life. Many destitute veterans and refugees turned to crime, the presence of so many soldiers made gambling and prostitution booming businesses, and the Corsican mafia under the leadership of men like Paul \"the Emperor\" Carbone, himself a veteran, further thrived on the smuggling of goods and people in and out of the métropole. The authorities, however, turn a blind eye to this, as the mafia has proved to be an incredibly useful network of informants within the Commune, all the while attending to the baser needs of infantrymen and officers alike."

nfa.410.t:0 "Louis Blériot Dies"
nfa.410.d:0 "Louis Blériot, born in 1872, engineer, inventor and pioneer of French aviation has died of cardiac arrest in his Algiers villa at only 64 years old. Fascinated with the idea of flying and inspired by the prototypes of French engineer Clément Ader and the successes of the Wright brothers, Blériot put the profits of his automobile parts business towards the creation of flying machines. First encountering so many failures that the press derisively nicknamed him the \"King of Crashing\", he eventually achieved worldwide fame and recognition for being the first to cross the Channel in an aeroplane in 1909, in only 37 minutes. A living legend of aviation, even being attributed to the first pilot’s license, he created a successful firm building his ever-improving designs. With the Great War, he specialised in light reconnaissance planes, his company producing eventually more than ten thousand planes for the French army. At the outbreak of the revolution, Blériot fled to Algeria like so many others and successfully re-implemented his business, Blériot Aéronautique, the Marshal encouraging research and development in any field with any potential to help the coming war effort, eventually running as a candidate for the Parti Radical.\n\nFollowing his death, the government has put out a statement honouring his contribution to the field of aviation and to the war effort, as well as his resilience facing his early setback, calling him an example to all Frenchmen in these difficult times. The creation of a Louis Blériot medal, to be awarded to record setters in speed, altitude or distance in light aircraft, was also announced."

nfa.411.t:0 "Murder Rocks the Casbah"
nfa.411.d:0 "As he was on his way to the Sidi Ramadan mosque, the great mufti of Algiers, Mahmoud Bendali, was surrounded by two men and stabbed in the heart, dying on the spot. The two perpetrators were caught after a quick investigation and confessed to the murder, justifying their actions by saying the mufti had acted against the Islamic faith and was little more than a puppet of the infidels. Appointed by the colonial authorities first as imam then as a mufti, unpopular and frequently brazenly critical of even mild reformist talk, Bendali had many powerful enemies. After a rough interrogation session, the murderer confessed to being merely a pawn in a greater scheme, offered thousands of francs to kill the imam by the true mastermind behind the crime: a prominent member of the reformist Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, Tayeb el-Okbi. Already banned from preaching in mosques by colonial authorities, the man had been under police surveillance for some time, suspected of conspiring against the state under the pretence of religious reform: he was immediately arrested and is awaiting trial.\n\nHowever, many Algerians and some Frenchmen believe this is a conspiracy, and that el-Okbi was falsely implicated in this affair by colonial police eager to have such an inconvenience disappear. Whether that accusation is true or not, this case is quickly turning into an embarrassment. We could drop charges against el-Okbi, somewhat losing face but preventing any further unrest and possibly gaining an ally within the Association, or we could keep him in jail, getting rid of a prominent indigène leader and sowing dissent among the ulemas."

nfa.412.t:0 "A Legionnaire"
nfa.412.d:0 "The latest movie starring comedic superstar Fernandel, \"A Legionnaire\", has been, like almost everything the actor touches, a success. A master of physical comedy and slapstick, adding to it a talent for singing, his movies generally featuring a few humorous songs that then prove to be successes in their own right, he has often been compared to American actor Charlie Chaplin. This time the actor plays Fernand, a hen-pecked husband who, after getting knocked out, wakes up in a caravan heading towards the Algerian interior, his identity papers stolen and replaced by new ones: he is now another man, a new volunteer in the French Foreign Legion. Incapable of explaining his situation to his officer, Fernand is called to fight some unruly tribe deep in the Sahara desert, and despite early mishaps, he quickly finds military life much more enjoyable than his marriage, and especially much less disciplined. Now truly a whole new man, he is eventually tracked down by his wife but instead chooses to re-enlist under his real name, becoming a veritable hero and eventually being awarded the Legion of honour.The humorous tale has proven particularly popular among veterans."
nfa.412.a:0 "Fernandel did it again!"

nfa.413.t:0 "Journal d’un Curé de Campagne"
nfa.413.d:0 "Today, the Grand Prize of the Académie Française, one of the oldest and most prestigious literary awards in France, has been awarded to Georges Bernanos for his novel entitled the \"Diary of a Country Priest\", published earlier this year, finding great critical and commercial success. Through the touching story of a young priest in a small village in northern France, Bernanos tackles themes such as spirituality, death, the battle between Good and Evil, destiny, the role of the Church under an anticlerical regime, but also selflessness, hope, salvation and grace. Struggling with a lack of authority, with a lack of funds, with the growing impiety of his flock, and with local authorities oscillating between derisive mockery and outright hostility, the parish priest puts extreme zeal and selflessness into attempting to save the souls of his parishioners, sometimes falling into despair but never giving up his fight, a fight perhaps lost in advance but a fight bringing him closer to God. Culminating with the conversion of the chairman of the local council, the book ends on a bittersweet note, the young curé himself dying shortly after of stomach cancer, softly uttering \"All is Grace\".\n\nA monarchist, but praising the spirit of revolt of 1789, violently opposed to syndicalism but just as violently opposed to the bourgeoisie, close to the Action Française but often conflicting with their views, profoundly Catholic, but criticizing clergy more concerned with order than salvation, considering himself neither right nor left-wing, but simply Christian, George Bernanos is a man full of contradiction. Nevertheless, with this \"Diary\", a work full of his sincere faith and spirituality, he has touched the whole nation, if not the whole Catholic world."

nfa.414.t:0 "Second Bureau"
nfa.414.d:0 "A new movie has taken French cinemas by storm: \"Deuxième Bureau\", directed by Pierre Billon. After numerous production delays and a harsh reception by critics, the commercial success of this thrilling tale of espionage is a surprise. Telling the story of captain Benoit, played by Jean Murat, sent on a mission by the Second Bureau, our elusive military intelligence agency, to seize the blueprints of the latest red weapon in the very heart of the Commune, this movie has it all: action, suspense, and of course, romance. Of course, the handsome captain is eventually noticed by Communard counter-intelligence, who sends their best agent after him: Elise, true femme fatale, tasked with seducing the agent. Of course the two fall in love, and plan on escaping together: as the Communards realise this, she sacrifices herself and dies in her lover’s arms, forcefully reminded of his duty to France.\n\nCritics hated it, calling it cheap entertainment, and yet, the public loved it, and asked for more, dismissing rumours that the film received state funding to transform the public image of the secretive and sometimes sinister agency as mere Communard propaganda."

nfa.415.t:0 "The Archangel Disappears"
nfa.415.d:0 "Jean Mermoz, nicknamed the Archangel, is a veteran pilot who turned to airmail transport after the war, becoming a pioneer in the field and accumulating countless feats of adventure, such as surviving a crash in the Sahara and captivity in the hands of rebel Tuaregs, becoming the first to cross the South Atlantic from Senegal to Brazil and then the first to cross the Andes by plane. His exploits are told like epic tales in newspapers and newsreels, and he has become something of a national hero, even getting involved in politics with Colonel de La Rocque’s PSF and advocating for the development of air travel. But a few days ago, on his twenty-fifth cross-Atlantic flight the aviator disappeared. Circumstances are still unclear and the fate of Mermoz is still unknown, with headlines reading \"The Disappearance of the Archangel\", and articles sounding more and more like eulogies with each new edition. The whole nation awaits with bated breath any news from the Atlantic."

nfa.416.d:0 "After more than a week without news from Jean Mermoz and the crew of his Latécoère 300 Croix-du-Sud However, little hope was left for their safe return home. However, today, a miracle happened: Mermoz and his exhausted, sunburned, thirsty but very much alive crew were found drifting in the ocean by a Brazilian ship. The news, just like the pilot, quickly crossed the South Atlantic and spread like wildfire, cinemas and theatres even interrupting their programming to inform the audience. Public relief is palpable, the government has put out an official statement thanking the Brazilian authorities and a hero’s welcome is already being planned for the Archangel."

nfa.417.t:0 "Pépé le Moko"
nfa.417.d:0 "\"Pépé le Moko\", a melodrama starring rising actor Jean Gabin and the already famous Mireille Balin has quickly found great success at home and even abroad. Set in Algiers, particularly in the labyrinthic and exotic old town, the Casbah, the movie tells the story of Pépé, played by Gabin, a former big shot in the Parisian underworld now in hiding, and the men trying to catch him, both law enforcement and syndicalist agents looking to put down once and for all a major organizer of the black market within the Commune. Settling in comfortable exile, rebuilding a criminal empire, the gangster is soon thrown off balance by the arrival of Gaby, played by Balin, mistress of a prominent businessman looking to \"slum it\" among natives and emigrants in the sensual and dangerous world of the Casbah. The two strike up a relationship, igniting the jealousy of Pépé’s mistress. This love triangle is followed with great interest by the police, who use the two women to slowly push the gangster to take more and more risks and eventually leave hiding. Surrounded, knowing his doom is a matter of time, facing an eternity in prison or assassination by red agents, Pépé instead decides to go out on his terms, committing suicide as he spots Gaby in the distance.\n\nA gripping, suspenseful tale of love and treason, with its tear-jerking ending, shot entirely on location, it’s hardly surprising that the movie has found such tremendous success, some seeing it as an instant classic. And Pépé, quintessential anti-hero, criminal but principled, has become a bit of a youth icon as many identify with his situation at the crossroad of two worlds, French and native, as well as with his melancholic longing for Paris."

Some say the shrewd businessman even hired students and soldiers on leave to order the drink: if that rumour is accurate, the strategy was effective, making Orangina immediately trendy and kickstarting its popularity. Already coffee houses all over the colonies are ordering crates after crates of the sugary drink, a boom sure to stimulate the agricultural sector, the climate of Algeria being perfectly suited to cultivate citrus fruits."

nfa.419.t:0 "Algerian Muslim Scouts"
nfa.419.d:0 "In 1935, a scouting troop for Muslim boys was created by Mohamed Bouras, supported by reformists ulemas, traditional elites, and reform-minded Frenchmen, all hoping that scouting would promote physical and moral education, character building, a sense of responsibility, as well as duty to Allah and the motherland. Hundreds of troops have been created since, proving popular among all classes as many young boys and teenagers flock to them, drawn by promises of adventure, a sense of belonging, as well as dashing uniforms with red and green bandanas. Drawing from Lord Baden-Powell’s books, the boys learn how to camp and survive, sing songs, participate in religious ceremonies like Eid or Mawlid, where they parade in uniform, the groups even organising mass Khitan, circumcision of boys around seven years old, an occasion of much celebration that poor families could otherwise not afford. However, these groups have remained largely isolated from each other, merely sharing values, a flag, and a uniform. As such, representatives from the various troops have asked the colonial administration its blessing to create a Federation of Algerian Muslim Scouts that would permit greater cooperation and uniformisation of scouting practices among the indigènes. Already, prominent native voices like Ferhat Abbas and a diverse coalition of French reformists campaign for the official approval of such a federation, arguing that it would promote traditional values along with loyalty to France, while some more conservative pieds-noirs argue that the boy scouts are groomed for a red-green jihad by the syndicalist agents of Messali Hadj, that native scouting is a bad idea altogether, and that the patrie they are loyal to is not France, but Algeria. More pragmatic voices in government argue that giving our approval to this federation would grant us much greater oversight over a largely autonomous initiative."

nfa.420.d:0 "Sombre Dimanche, \"Gloomy Sunday\" is a melancholic song, telling the sinister story of a spurned lover who committed suicide, addressing from beyond the grave the man who left her. Composed by a Hungarian exile in the Commune in 1935, the song made its way across the world, first becoming a mainstay of seedy concert halls and cabarets before reaching mainstream audiences when it was first recorded in French by the popular singer Damia. In these trying times, it’s hardly surprising that the peoples of Europe and beyond are prone to melancholy, however, rumours have been circulating about the song: that it is linked with an ever-increasing number of suicides, in France, the United States, and the composer’s homeland, Hungary, and that merely listening to the tune could push even the cheeriest individual towards suicidal ideation. Whether this is a fact, a mere urban rumour, or a clever marketing campaign, the song has already been banned from airing on the radio or even being sung publicly in more than a few countries, which only adds to the credibility of rumours about the now-infamous \"Hungarian suicide song\".\n\nHere too, a debate has raged on the question of a potential ban, an almost welcome break from the usual political fracas.

nfa.421.d:0 "The Companions of Joan of Arc is an association honouring the memory of the patron saint of France, canonized in 1920 in the aftermath of the revolution. Founded in 1930 by Maxime Real del Sarte, an artist close to the Action Française, after the man organised for a relic of the saint to be smuggled out of the Commune, the association describes itself as apolitical, simply stating that it seeks to \"bring together all those of goodwill around she who saved France in her hour of need and who so perfectly embodies our aspirations for the freedom of our nation\". And indeed each year the patriotic celebrations organised around the shrine built for the relic are more and more popular, with tens of thousands in attendance for a day culminating in an open-air mass, including numerous parliamentarians, officials, bishops, intellectuals, veterans, and officers, and this year even [NFA.GetLeader] himself.\n\nHowever despite the association claiming that it seeks to remain apolitical, and the \"Pucelle\" being revered by most of the political spectrum, many seek to use the event to further their political agenda. Both the Action Française and the Parti Social Français have repeatedly been caught distributing leaflets, supporters of the two parties sometimes even coming to blows. However, these minor incidents have not hampered the general enthusiasm for the celebrations, and the Companions expect even more attendance next year."

nfa.422.d:0 "\"To the Spanish Martyrs\" is a poem by dramatist and diplomat Paul Claudel, a deeply conservative, devout Catholic, a long-time critic of the anticlerical Third Republic, who became a sort of official poet of the Pétain regime, his long religious plays earning him unending praise and even a Nobel prize nomination. However, he had largely steered clear off politics, his post as diplomat demanding strict reserve on these matters. The crisis unfolding in Spain has however changed this attitude and prompted him into action, particularly emerging tales of red terror, profanations, and acts of syndicalist violence against Catholic clergy and laity, all ringing eerily familiar to the exiles. Claudel has pleaded with the government to provide unconditional support for the Spanish royalists that he believes are engaged in a holy war against the forces of evil. Committees of support towards this cause have already begun to appear, raising funds, organising volunteers, and engaging in what can only be described as propaganda effort on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain with often tacit support from the Catholic hierarchy. The poem, \"Aux Martyrs Espagnols\" calls on the reader to stand up against the red Neros and Diocletians, lists reported acts of persecution, and exalts a holy Spain that will be reborn through the blood of the martyrs: it has by now appeared on leaflets, mocked for its rather emotional and verbose prose, endlessly quoted by supporters of the Spanish kingdom, and been quickly translated and spread through much of the Catholic world, Paul Claudel becoming a sort of figurehead of the Spanish cause."

nfa.423.d:0 "Football was introduced in North Africa by the French: amateur clubs made up of colonists and garrisoned soldiers formed as early as the 1890s, with the Oran Athletic Club claiming to be the oldest football club in not just Algeria, but all of Africa. Slowly, indigènes clubs formed, the first being Algiers Mouloudia Club in 1921, and these days football has become an incredibly popular pastime for many of our citizens, with children playing in every street, stadiums being built, and solid fanbases consolidating around clubs that pop up in every neighbourhood. Regrouped into departmental leagues, these amateur clubs participate in a year-long competition, the best eventually competing in the North African Football Cup with clubs from Algeria, Tunisia, and even Morocco. These matches draw huge crowds, the occasion to play out in a most friendly manner rivalry between nations, regions, and between colonists and natives. This latter phenomenon has increasingly worried authorities, who want to avoid at all costs that Muslim clubs begin incarnating any kind of contestation of colonial order: however, banning these clubs would simply be making martyrs of them, and so instead the government has opted for a policy of integration, pressuring clubs to field both natives and colonists. A policy that has proved unpopular on both sides but slowly seems to be bearing fruits.\n\nThis year, the North Africa cup final was played between the Algiers University Racing and Algiers Gallia Sport, with the university club winning 2-0 after a tense match and goals narrowly avoided by the club’s goalkeeper, a young man named Albert Camus."

nfa.424.t:0 "La Grande Illusion"
nfa.424.d:0 "\"The Grand Illusion\", a war film featuring an all-star cast, is quickly becoming the most successful and controversial movie of the last few years. Set in a German prison camp during the Great War, the movie follows three French officers, one of working-class background, an aristocrat, and a nouveau riche naturalised Polish Jew and their efforts to escape captivity. Their plots foiled multiple times, the men never lose hope, promising each other to meet in Paris once the war is won. The officers cautiously fraternise with their German jailer, but never lose sight of their goal, and the aristocrat sacrifices himself to allow his companions to escape. Travelling through the German countryside, eventually being sheltered by a widow, one falls in love. However, his sense of duty forces him to continue his journey back to France, and the officers are finally able to rejoin the fight. The end, however, is ambiguous: a final shot shows an empty table of a Parisian restaurant, as heavy fighting seems to take place outside, leaving the fate of the men unknown.\n\nThe movie, tackling a wide variety of themes such as class, prejudice, patriotism and duty with phenomenal actors and humour, has been a hit. However, its humanistic approach, showcasing sympathetic German characters, as well as characters who consider the war ultimately futile has been hotly debated, with many accusing the movie of pacifism. Abroad the reception has been mixed, as the movie was heavily censored in Germany, dismissed as reactionary propaganda in the Commune for its themes of class collaboration and showcase of the aristocracy as laudable tragic figures, but praised in the United States, even being shown in the White House. In any case, it has become an instant classic."

nfa.425.d:0 "Since 1861, the principality of Monaco has had close relations with France: nominally independent, the tiny state heavily relied on France and most of its flourishing economy depended on French money, invested or lost in Monte Carlo’s casinos, the two neighbours eventually agreeing to sign a treaty of \"protective friendship\". Staying neutral in 1914, the principality eventually found itself in a difficult situation, with the civil war in France and revolution brewing in Italy. As communard militias were closing in on the Rock, symbol of rampant capitalism under which the bourgeoisie gambled away the produce of the proletariat’s hard work, Albert I chose exile, taking with him the fabulous riches of the Grimaldi family and setting up a court in exile, before being succeeded by his son in 1922. Louis II had served as an officer in the Foreign Legion, fighting at the Marne and the Chemin des Dames, earning himself the nickname of \"Soldier-Prince\" and a promotion to the rank of general. Since his coronation, Louis has been desperately fighting for his unilaterally annexed principality. He has found some success, extracting recognition of his government-in-exile from countries opposed to the Commune. An admirer of Marshal Pétain, the Prince has furthermore been funding various right and far-right initiatives, steering clear however of the Action Française, which had run a vicious press campaign against the principality during the Great War, Monaco being smeared as a den of German spies and Jewish capital.\n\nBut today is a joyous occasion, as the tiny Monégasque community in exile celebrates Sovereign's Day, Monaco’s national day falling on the Prince’s patron saint’s feast. A lavish party has been organised, with many of France’s political elites and numerous foreign diplomats being assembled in the prince’s palace on the outskirts of Algiers, an occasion he will no doubt use to further his cause."

Born in a royalist family but rallied to the Republic, he turned down the opportunity of a military career and instead dedicated his life to pedagogy and sports, himself a proficient athlete, promoting the integration of physical activity in education. But de Coubertin had an even greater objective: popularise sports by internationalising them and for them to become an instrument of peace and greater understanding between the peoples through peaceful competition and sportsmanship. Hoping to further this utopian goal, de Coubertin turned to Ancient Greece and her Panhellenic games, and the first Olympics in almost two millennia took place in 1894 in Athens.\n\nBut even the reborn Olympics couldn’t prevent the madness of the Great War, and following the revolution, the baron had to flee to Algeria like so many others. Already heartbroken by the death at the front of two nephews, the diplomatic blunder of the 1924 Berlin Olympics, that neither Frances attended, and the subsequent establishment of the Spartakiades, left de Coubertin a broken shell of a man, his dream crumbling before his eyes. Following the announcement of his death, the government nonetheless put out a statement praising him, and the Greek government has announced its intention to build a monument honouring the baron in Olympia."

Viticulture in a region that is populated in the vast majority by alcohol-abstinent Muslims might seem peculiar, but Algeria is well suited for growing grapes, with it’s warm, sunny climate. Winemaking has historically been one of the engines of French colonisation of the region, promoting the development of much land and infrastructure, quickly becoming the go-to enterprise for prospective colonists of relatively little means and the principal source of income of the colony. Since the exile, business has of course been booming: viticulturists can barely keep up with the demand, as hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen each year consume bottle after bottle, and legal importation of wine from the métropole is of course impossible. Though Algerian vintage is still considered of somewhat lower quality by much of our French population, that remembers fondly wine from Bordeaux or Bourgogne, it is slowly gaining some prestige, thanks to the hard work of exiles aiming to bring production up to the standards of the motherland: perhaps one day these wines will be as renowned as those of the métropole."

In this essay, the heir traces back the origins of the poor working and living conditions of the proletariat to the Revolution of 1789, a \"bourgeois coup\" that he claims turned the proud artisans and farmers of old into proletarians by destroying traditional structures such as guilds and enabling economic liberalism. He chronicles the slow descent into indignity of the working classes over the last century and a half, caused by usurious industrial capitalism and new illegitimate elites, culminating in the 1919 revolution, an event that he considers engineered by nefarious forces exploiting the legitimate grievances of the masses. Prince Henri then makes a passionate case for the monarchy, the only regime he claims could truly restore the dignity of the people by upholding tradition and the Social Doctrine of the Church.\n\nThe work was well-received and sold well, thanks to tireless promotion by the Action Française and praise by influential clergy, already being translated in multiple languages and published abroad, though some were shocked by the violence of Henri’s denunciation of capitalism and the bourgeoisie.

Much of its collections are recent acquisitions: indeed, the government-funded extensive ethnographic expeditions in our present and former colonial possessions in an effort to consolidate our hold on outlying territories. The 1931 Dakar-Djibouti Mission alone, for example, made up of linguists, ethnographers, naturalists, painters, photographers and even a musicologist, brought back more than 3000 objects, 6000 photographs, 1600 meters of photographic film, and 1500 pages of notes documenting invaluable information on a rapidly disappearing way of life.\n\nThough there has been criticism over the manner of acquisition of its collections, some radical newspapers even going as far as making accusations of racket, the opening ceremony of the museum was a success, attended by the mayor of Algiers, the minister of the colonies and thousands of curious Algérois, pieds-noirs and indigènes alike."

But it is the ending that has most divided the opinion, as the crazed man who had vowed to end all wars, temporarily relapses into sanity to find that the world is getting ready for a new great conflict. He springs into action, and in a supernatural storm calls on the millions of dead of the Weltkrieg, regardless of their nationality, to rise from their grave and punish the living for their foolish obsession with mutual destruction. All over Europe, the dead of all countries hear his call, unite and march on, creating mass panic and preventing another war.\n\nAccused of pacifism, of sullying the memory of our war heroes by some, praised for his skill by others, Gance escaped censorship due to his links with veterans associations: indeed, many veterans were employed during the filming of the movie, and in particular many \"gueules-cassées\", broken faces, for the great finale. The dead might not rise and march on to prevent a Second Weltkrieg, but those disfigured by the last war want to have their voices heard as war frenzy in our nation rages on."

Tenacious, quick, and with incredible precision, some see in him immense potential, despite his one real weakness: fragile hands, earning him his other nickname, \"The Man with Clay Hands\".\n\nBorn in a poor pieds-noirs family of Spanish origins, speaking French, Arabic, and Spanish, having left school at 11, drifting from job to job until his father realised his true worth as a boxer, Marcel’s success story has turned him into a popular icon. No matter the community, Arabs, immigrants, pieds-noirs, exiles, the public sees him as a true self-made man, coming from nothing and yet climbing ever higher through sheer effort and strength of character. His national title well earned, he is now looking into joining the European fray: the whole nation will follow with great interest his career from now on, cheering him on, perhaps even all the way to a world champion title."

Though still small, the community hopes to attract more members seeking a life of work, prayer, and service to the natives, with whom relations have so far been peaceful.\n\nFar from being the only monastic community in a similar situation, Catholic media and hierarchy have nonetheless praised this latest example of religious coexistence, while others see the abbey as a shining example of the civilising mission of France in her colonies. However, some have expressed worry: the community is far from the centres of colonial life and most importantly their garrisons. But the monks have assured that they have nothing to fear from their neighbours and that they are in any case under the protection of the Virgin Mary, to whom they have erected a great statue overlooking the valley."

Born during the Weltkrieg to a failed singer and a street acrobat, raised in a brothel for most of her childhood in the torment of revolution, she was nonetheless blessed with an incredible voice, her harsh life has given her a haunting depth and sensibility. Having started her career as a street singer, she quickly started performing in cabarets and workers’ clubs, singing about working-class life and struggles. Soon, she was on the radio, and inevitably her songs would cross the sea and the embargo. Her records are played in the packed clubs of Algiers, as Frenchmen let the nostalgia of their homeland be soothed by Piaf’s striking Parisian accent and tales of the atmosphere of the shady parts of the City of Lights.\n\nSome find her songs scandalous, while others insist these songs are coated in syndicalist propaganda, but the government is doing nothing to stop the spread of her records and it is rumoured that she has admirers in high places. Amusingly, she has proved equally controversial in the Commune: there, she has been accused of encouraging bourgeois degeneracy and singing counter-revolutionary propaganda about the living conditions of the proletariat, though thankfully these complaints fall on equally deaf ears."

By the author’s admission, however, the plot of the book is largely there to serve its historical and ethnographic qualities. Indeed, Hazoumé aims to accurately depict life before European colonisation \"to facilitate the understanding of the Black mind by the coloniser\", proving along the way that Dahomeans and Africans in general are not so different from “civilized” people and that they too have a long and rich history worthy of being studied.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic family in 1890 in Porto-Novo, Hazoumé is himself Dahomean. Educated in a Catholic mission, then moving to Sénégal to further his studies, Hazoumé wrote in local newspapers, sharing a generally pro-French sentiment but never shying away from criticism of the excesses of the colonial administration. As Dahomey was ceded to Germany, he started a teaching career while writing articles published in both French and German territory. Earning himself the respect of his European colleagues and a job at the Museum of Man, Paul Hazoumé has now reached new heights by becoming the first African man to earn such a distinction. This decision which could have proved controversial has instead been generally met with praise from much of colonial society, though for varying reasons: where some évolués see proof, if one was ever needed, of the intellectual equality of the Black man, some in the colonial government see proof of the success of the civilising mission."

Their relationship is cordial and polite enough, though understandably chilly due to geopolitical considerations, but a fight breaking out between sailors of the different crews prevents any further fraternisation. However, an incident brings them together: arms traffickers are spotted leaving the harbour, and in their flight have released poison gas. The deadly cloud is slowly drifting towards a passenger ship, and the men put aside their differences to save the civilians, going straight through the gas with little protection: the civilians are rescued and the traffickers stopped. Despite their heroism, all the crews lose some men, including the Red British officer, and they are all buried with full military honours.\n\nDirected by the profoundly Catholic director Léo Joannon, filmed at sea with the help of our navy, on real ships and with real sailors as extras, the movie was hit with criticism from some who found distasteful the positive image of the German and British characters, going as far as taxing the movie of pacifism. Against such critics, the director argued that the core message of the picture is one of Christian fraternity, bravery and camaraderie in the face of adversity, despite eternally rising international tensions."

This measure was necessary to coordinate the various actions taken by opponents to the syndicalist regime such as the distribution of tracts, preparations to hamper the war effort, recruitment, bribery, or discrete weapon training as tensions ramp up a bit more each day. Though the resistance is still far from being able to rise as one against the Communards, establishing this radio station will go a long way towards making sure the efforts of our brothers will not be in vain: once we land on our shores, they will be ready to do all they can to free France."

From this milieu emerged the first academic studies of Oriental Religions and Metaphysical Systems. However, following the defeat, this nascent community of Occultists and Orientalists has broken in two, with violent embrace or rejection of the new socialist regime. René Guénon is firmly in the camp of anti-Syndicalists, having followed the government in exile, written anti-Materialist tracts and published "The Crisis of the Modern World" in which he rejects the concept of progress in favour of Hindu Cyclical Time. However he is equally highly controversial even within the far right, arguing in favour of Ultramontanism, on the basis of the supremacy of the Brahmin over the Kshatriya, and having recently converted to Sufi Islam and exited his Masonic Lodge. His most recent book, “Oriental Metaphysics” is a detailed exploration of Oriental Metaphysical Systems, drawing links between Catholicism and Eastern religions as sharing a primordial tradition. It has been embraced by certain parts of the Far Right who see these systems as a way to escape the Liberal worldview of their recent past in favour of a Traditionalist system free of the evils of Progress. Others however have rejected it violently seeing this as the resurrection of Gnosticism within the Christian Vanguard, with some wishing it to be banned. The book has caused significant controversy and lively debate, particularly between Guénon and Catholic neo-thomist philosopher Jacques Maritain, getting a surprising amount of success with even relatively mainstream audiences.

Some out of genuine interest or hope of interfaith dialogue, while others dream of large-scale conversion of the indigènes to Christianity. A recent open letter published anonymously in “En Terre d’Islam” is threatening the fragile religious equilibrium, however. The letter, calling for the formation of a “Friday Prayer League for the Conversion of the Muslims” to “pray for our estranged brothers” was well received within Catholic circles and would have likely not reached Muslim audiences if not for the identity of its author, leaked to the wider press in the following days: Father Jean-Mohamed Ben Abdejlil.\n\nThe man was recently ordained to the priesthood, becoming a professor at the Catholic Institute of Algiers last year. And yet, ten years ago, he was its first Muslim student. Coming from a prominent Morrocan family, a brilliant youth, fervent in his faith, he came under the protection of Marshal Lyautey, who encouraged him to further his studies in Algiers. There, he met famed orientalist Louis Massignon and Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain. He had joined hoping to “study the enemy”, a year later he would convert, two and he joined the Fransciscan Order. This high profile conversion had largely been swept under the rug due to fears of unrest, apostasy being a particularly severe act in Islam: such fears have been confirmed. The letter, translated and mistranslated, was widely shared in mosques and madrassas, and overwhelmingly received with contempt, if not anger, with even threats being directed towards Father Jean-Mohamed, who has gone into hiding."

Going through most major towns of the Algerian littoral, such as Orléanville, Oran, Bone, starting and ending in Algier, with even a detour through Tunisia, the race was a massive popular success, giving bicycle racing fans the euphoria of a national sporting competitions they had seeked for close to two decades by now. And with a win by French cyclist Roger Lapébie boosting national pride, we have every reason to make this competition a yearly event, despite the whispers of killjoys that we might be 'settling in exile'."

nfa.504.d:0 "Today, a distinguished young man walked in a Légion étrangère recruitment office, not far from the Morrocan border. A strange sight for the officer in charge of processing his application, more used to foreign men of dubious pasts, willing to serve and die for France for a chance at a new life. He gave Henri Robert Orliac as his name, and the officer did not care if that was the truth. Like so many others in these bellicose days, Orliac was then integrated in the troop, once in a simple recruit uniform only somewhat standing out from his peers.\nTruth is, Henri was not an ordinary recruit: his real name is Henri d'Orléans, royal prince of the House of France. In the Great War, his father too had attempted to join the Foreign Legion but was denied from it due the Law of Exile barring representatives of the former reigning houses from setting foot in France. But young Henri, eager to serve France in this great crusade against socialism, could not be deterred from doing his duty. One day, perhaps the prince will be called to rule over the nation, but for now he will serve the nation in other ways."

nfa.505.t:0 "The Men in Green"
nfa.505.d:0 "The Communards have announced a program to transform culture and entertainment, a so-called 'International Avant-Garde' of radical 'artists' aiming to tear down all that is beautiful in this world and transform it to fit the tastes of madmen, all in the name of making art more palatable to the proletariat. Put it simply, they aim to do nothing less than destroy French culture. In their manifesto is professed a need to abolish the canons of French literature and poetry as well as radically transform the rules of French grammar, decried as antiquated and bourgeois. \nTo protest this crime against taste, culture, beauty, and, frankly, civilisation itself, the men of the various académies of the Institute of France have assembled in a common congress to produce a counter-manifesto. All clad in their green-trimmed formal attire, complete with personalised ornate swords and bicornes, the 473 members of the Institute have signed a common appeal to the world to undermine the efforts of these 'perverts' and 'bohemians', and penned a manifesto in which they call for the creation of a international 'Institute of Occident' to fight the 'vanguard of inculture'. This initiative has received wide acclaim in France and among our Entente allies, as well as from the German sphere. \nAs for the International Avant-Garde, it responded by setting up an abstract statue representing 'bourgeois culture' and 'classicism' made out of copies of the manifesto in front of the former location of the Institut de France, in Paris. As the inauguration ceremony was underway, it was set ablaze by known lunatic Georges Bataille, a move that was applauded as an example of 'pure artistic spontaneity' by the organisation."

Military parades as well as popular street celebrations and fireworks are planned all across France, in a joyous celebration of the greatness of our nation.\n\nFor long, what is even celebrated on this day has been a topic of heated debate between left and right. The left would insist that this is a day celebrating the 1789 storming of the Bastille fortress, a Parisian royal prison and armory, widely considered as the starting point of the French Revolution, while the right would on the contrary consider that this is a day commemorating the Fête de la Fédération, a massive holiday festival that took place across France a year later to celebrate the unity of the French nation, and an end of the political struggle, of the Revolution itself. History proved that hope wrong, but this hasn’t stopped this debate from arising every year. The 1880 law instituting the National Day on the 14th of July simply abstains from taking a side, but thankfully we have since put the controversy to rest, as an amendment voted by the Assembly some years ago has clarified that we are indeed commemorating the Festival of the Federation today."

nfa.507.t:0 "The Ulema"
nfa.507.d:0 "The 'Association des oulémas musulmans algériens' or Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema is a religious association founded in 1933. Under the unofficial leadership of Abdelhamid Ben Badis, this association of theologians, teachers and more generally learned men has come to promote Islamic reform, hoping to bring Islam in Algeria to its pure original form, away from the superstitions fostered by the marabouts and the more mystical approach of the Sufi congregations. Taking inspiration from similar initiatives which found success in the Middle East and Tunisia, many schools have already been created, teaching grammar, mathematics and religion to children, and theology, philosophy, history as well as Islamic and French law to young adults, quickly becoming a major influence in mosques all over the region and attracting the suspicion of colonial authorities.\n\nIndeed, one of stated goals of the Association is to foster the Islamic identity of Algeria, to unite the people beyond the divide between Berbers and coastal arabophone Algerians and beyond tribal boundaries. Though they stop short of advocating for independence, they strongly oppose assimilation, claiming that an Algerian nation does exist, which could not become French and does not want to be French. As such they have already found themselves becoming an important player in the politics of the Algerian departments. First, authorities unsuccessfully sought to co-opt the association, much like the rest of the Islamic clergy in the colonies, as banning the already powerful group would certainly create unrest. Then, two native groups came to seek the support of the ulema: the Action Algérienne of Ferhat Abbas, which claims that should the Action Française come to power an autonomous Algerian identity could be fostered and traditional and Islamic law could be fully restored, and the Étoile Nord-Africaine of Messali Hadj, a syndicalist-aligned underground group which advocates for the independence of Algeria with the support of the Commune. So far, the Association has not sided with either, skeptical of both the sincerity of the AF’s promises of autonomy and the anticlerical socialism advocated by the Communards."

nfa.508.d:0 "Though the Bear has emphasized the need for a strong, united nation in the face of the arduous task at hand, he has been met with some resistance, particularly from disappointed former allies who had hoped that with the fall of Pétain democracy would be immediately restored, believing that mere promises of elections and a new constitution are not enough. Some dare to whisper that the Comité is merely a front for a renewed dictatorship under Mordacq, and already some intellectuals and politicians openly criticise the General. However, one thing that was restored immediately after the fall of Pétain is freedom of expression: these men have the right to speak their mind, no matter how wrong they are, and how potentially destabilising this kind of talk is.\n\nWe could simply let it go and hope the debate runs its course, or we could take a more proactive approach. One possibility would be using legal means to silence these critics, by accusing them of defamation: juries would no doubt rule in our favor and force these men to publicly recant."

nfa.509.d:0 "Though the mobilisation of the nation has been chugging along and finally a brighter future for France is being prepared by the Comité, some still remain doubtful. Prominent voices among veterans of the democratic cause have now joined the usual naysayers: though they support Henri Mordacq, they seem to find cause for 'concern' and 'worry' in seemingly every little action taken by the government, and the media relishes in reporting on every front page these doubts expressed by friends and allies of the Bear. Finally free from censorship, it seems journalists are relishing in this effort to tear down the man who restored freedom of expression. The government has so far ignored the situation, but letting this criticism go unanswered much longer could durably undermine the new regime and jeopardise our efforts to save the nation. Of course restoring censorship would be unthinkable, but there exist legal means to stifle this flow of defamation. However, we could also take a softer approach: by setting up regular press conferences broadcast to our people, the president of the Comité could directly address criticism and clear any doubt anyone might have about his allegiance to the Republic, to democracy."

nfa.510.d:0 "In an effort to stop unjust criticism by prominent journalists, intellectuals and politicians, the government attempted to directly contact the worst offenders and ask them to reconsider, and if they still had criticism, to voice it privately. Sadly, most of those concerned dismissed this invite, and as such it became necessary to use legal means to stop their seditious activities. Invoking the 1881 Law on the Freedom of the Press, they were accused of inciting 'offences against the public interest', and were put on trial. \nThis, however, backfired. Not only this made the Comité de Salut National look tyrannical, and made the criticism look founded, but it was utterly ineffective. The trials were turned into platforms for these men to criticise the new political order, arguing that it was at best another flavor of tyranny, and that this effort to stifle their right to freedom of expression went against the very ideals that led them to fight against the Pétain regime. Most were acquitted, other received at most small fines. It seems that in the future the Bear will have to contend with the liberties he supposedly fought to restore."

nfa.511.t:0 "A Chat with the Bear"
nfa.511.d:0 "The past weeks had proved difficult for the comité, as criticism grew from all sides. Some wanted censorship, Mordacq refused, and instead cooler heads prevailed: a press conference, broadcast to our people live, would be organised to dispel these accusations. When the Bear entered the room, in full uniform, his numerous medals, awarded for his long years of service to France, glistening in the spotlight, the room fell silent, as the men who had spoken so much against him were too intimidated by the now almost legendary general to open their mouths. It took a particularly brave foreign journalist to ask the one question on everyone’s mind: 'General, will you uphold the fundamental liberties of Frenchmen?'\n\nAnd finally, Mordacq spoke. 'It is true that we live in extraordinary times, and as such extraordinary measures are necessary. This is no longer the time for discussion but the time of action, and action, true action, action that produces results, requires a single will. We must unite if we want to win, and we must win for the salvation of France. However, and this has always been my promise to our people, these measures are indeed extraordinary and will not be maintained for more than they are necessary. Democracy has always been the hope of not only France, but all of Europe, I simply ask my fellow Frenchmen to trust the Comité and myself to lead them to victory. It will not be easy, but internal dissensions would make it impossible: fundamental liberties have been restored, and I ask you to use them wisely, for the sake of our patrie.'"

nfa.512.t:0 "Le Sacre"
nfa.512.d:0 "More than a hundred and ten years since there was last a royal coronation, France finally has a king once again. The ceremony was carefully organised to follow as closely as possible the millennium old protocol, despite taking place in the Saint-Philippe cathedral of Algiers instead of the traditional coronation in Reims, which current circumstances would make difficult to organise. Much of the necessary ceremonial items, like the sword Joyeuse, said to have been the sword of Charlemagne, as well as the Holy Ampulla, glass vial holding anointing oil said to have been given by the Holy Spirit for the baptism of Clovis, king of the Franks, had been evacuated during the retreat from the mainland and new regalia was crafted by skilled artisans, particularly an ornate crown.\n\nAfter swearing oaths on the Scriptures to defend the Church, maintain peace, fight injustice, be merciful and just, as well as fight heresy, Jean d’Orléans was anointed in nine spots in the shape of a cross with holy oil by the archbishop of Algiers, then was draped in a blue cloak sprinkled with gold fleurs-de-lys, given the scepter and the hand of justice, and, finally, crowned. Peers of the reborn kingdom swore fidelity to His Majesty, then a mass was said. This done, the king and the royal family headed out for their new residence, the former presidential palace in the heights of Algiers, cheered on the whole way there by a numerous crowd, public celebrations and banquets taking place well into the late hours of the night. Some important details were altered in the ceremony, however: the king did not swear the traditional oath to fight infidels and was instead given by the mufti of Algiers a traditional flyssa sword representing his new status of Hāmī al-Islām or Protector of Islam, and among the peers swearing fidelity to His Majesty were numerous Arab, Berber or African chiefs in their traditional costumes, symbol of a new era of French rule."

nfa.513.t:0 "Women's Suffrage"
nfa.513.d:0 "The issue of women’s suffrage has been a contentious one in French politics for a long while. At the revolution, women were considered “passive citizens”, a category shared with children and domestics: in other words citizens who were inherently under the influence of another and as such could not be trusted with the right to vote. In 1848, when the Second Republic was established and universal suffrage was declared, women were excluded from such universality. Idem when a Third Republic was declared in 1870. Though they were sympathies among more progressive republicans for the cause of women’s suffrage, they still considered that the vote of women would be used against the fragile republic. Furthermore, the Parti Radical, dominating French politics, and well known for its deep anti-clericalism, doubted the independence of women from the Church, a concern that was exacerbated in the years since the exile, as pope Benedict XV gave support for women’s suffrage in 1919: the republic then at its most vulnerable could not afford the risk of women voting along either their husband’s will, or worse,\n the Church’s.Charles Maurras has long defended in Action Française the right of women to vote: indeed, they had that right in France for centuries before the revolution, being called to vote in parish, communal or even regional assemblies and participating as equals in urban assemblies if they were widowed, for example. And as the Church has officially taken a position on the matter, now that we have finally freed France from the grasps of the Gueuse, it is our duty to right the wrongs committed by the republicans. As such, a royal decree has been published declaring that from now on, women would have the right and duty to participate in politics."

Chosen under the short-lived Second Republic, her representation became systematic under the Third, appearing in public buildings, statues, stamps, all things related to the state. But now freed from the republican shackles, France shall no longer be represented by a mere peasant, no longer is our people drinking the rotten milk from the diseased republican teat: busts in town halls have been taken down, statues brought down and destroyed by cheering Camelots. Instead, we will build symbols of the true France, such as statues of King Saint Louis and Saint Jeanne d’Arc, or representations of the royal lilies and the Gallic rooster. As for the official personification of our nation, we simply have to look to the past for inspiration. France had traditionally been represented as a woman in a blue cloak with golden fleurs de lys, armed or brandishing the royal hand of justice, often wearing a golden crown or a helmet, sometimes armored: a much more fitting symbol for the reborn Kingdom."

nfa.515.t:0 "A New National Day"
nfa.515.d:0 "Since 1880, the National Day has been set on the 14th of July: the left would generally consider that day as commemorating the 1789 storming of the Bastille, while the right would choose to commemorate the Feast of the Federation, a celebration that took place one year later and that at the time was considered by many as the end of political instability, an end to the revolution, and a celebration of national unity. The Republic could not afford to alienate either side, and as such never gave an official explanation. Either way, this celebration of either revolutionary bloodshed or constitutional monarchy is wildly inadequate for the restored regime.\n\nFrance did not have an official national day prior to the revolution, and as such three propositions have brought before the king. The feast day of Saint Louis, king of France, on the 25th of August had been the occasion for popular celebrations in honour of the king, and is the closest the Ancien Régime had to a National Day. However, since 1922 two saints have been declared by the papacy to be the primary patron saints of France: Our Lady on her Assumption, the 15th of August, as she has been traditionally considered Regnum Galliae, Queen of France, and Saint Joan of Arc, sent by God to free France, her feast day falling on the 30th of May, when her martyrdom took place.

The republican regime immediately got to work to thoroughly destroy France from the inside, gutting her traditions, cutting her off from the Faith and turning the Elder Daughter of the Church into the Gueuse, intent on spreading atheism, terror and destruction the world over. Those who bravely stood against this parasitic beast were mercilessly crushed, and hundreds of thousands of innocents were martyred on the altar of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. Though the Republic eventually fell thanks to the machinations of the impostor Bonaparte, the seeds the revolution planted continued to plague France until far too recently.\nAs such, King Jean III has decreed that a week of mourning in commemoration of the victims of the revolution would take place, with daily masses and processions to expiate the sins committed by our people not so long ago. However, this week, celebrations will be organised all over our territories to celebrate the counter-revolution and recent restoration of the rightful monarchy, as well our hope to soon extinguish another revolution."

Since then the “Prince-Soldier” Louis II has never lost his hope to restore the independence of Monaco and tirelessly lobbied the French government to include the restoration of the principality in any future war aims. To prove the princely commitment to their long-time allies and protectors, the heir to the principality Rainier even followed in the footsteps of his father and joined the French army in the later stages of the war, serving with distinction.\n\nWith Monaco freed from the grasps of the Communards, their loyalty has of course been rewarded and Louis II has officially proclaimed the restoration of the independence of the Principality from the balcony of the Prince's Palace in front of cheering Monégasques. Though a part of the population had initially welcomed the annexation, it quickly became clear that without independence, gambling or tourism, the former principality was little more than a backwards if pretty little town and opinion towards the Communards quickly soured. A treaty was signed later in the day with French representatives, deepening the mutual commitment of the two states towards each other already established by the 1918 treaty of 'protective friendship', and ensuring that the fate of France and Monaco would from now on forever be linked."

Coming from a prestigious family of ulema, claiming to be descendents from the medieval Zyrid dynasty which had ruled Ifriqiya centuries ago, Ben Badis was destined to a comfortable life as an Islamic scholar, part of the native elites far from the struggles of his fellow indigènes. Instead, his tutor made him promise at a young age to never serve the French, setting him on a course of tireless work for his people. He studied at the Ez-Zituna madrasa in Tunis, the oldest and one of the most prestigious centers of Islamic learning in all of the Maghreb, and it is there and during extended stays in the Middle East that he came to embrace a strongly reformist current of Islam, coming home with the hope of rooting out the unorthodox practices of the marabouts and sufis in his homeland and strengthening the Islamic identity of Algeria. One of the founding members of Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, he quickly became its unofficial head, helping to create many schools all over the region, advocating against assimilation and greatly participating in the struggle for the rights of the indigènes, particularly in his lifelong home, Constantine, the “City of Bridges”. As the Algerians mourn the death of a scholar and patriot, the pieds-noirs breathe a sigh of relief, as they always considered him a thorn in their side. As for the authorities, though they sent official condolences to the family of Ben Badis, some are wary of the consequences of his passing: after all, the man was rather moderate and always made sure the ulema always strayed clear of any kind of independentist talk."

Indeed, it seems that none of the operatives even know the name of their hierarchical superior and meetings are kept to a strict minimum. But we have finally been contacted by its leader, Alsatian textile industrialist Paul Dungler, nicknamed Commandant Martial, a citizen of the Reich. With German cash, given under the pretenses of funding study of the Genisteae flower in the hills of the Vosges region, Commandant Martial quickly built a disciplined network gathering information on Communard infrastructure and troop movements in the East, implementing weapons and explosives caches all over the Vosges and in Alsace, creating armed networks in Lorraine as well as stay-behind groups should the Commune advance past the Vosges. However, unbeknown to his German patrons, Dungler believes that Alsace is a rightful part of France and his network has been gathering an immense wealth of information from within the German intelligence framework as well as cultivating links within the armies of the Reich of disgruntled Alsatian soldiers and officers.\n\nHe has now offered us his services as a double agent, giving us access to his network to prepare the liberation of France, and we would be foolish to refuse. Though the Germans know his network as the Réseau Martial (Martial Network), to us he will become the “Alsace 7th Column”, as the deeply Catholic Dungler believes 7 is a holy number.

Despite these conciliatory words, for close to two decades they enviously observed as we spread French civilisation and built a globe-spanning empire. More than once, we rebuked their attempts at expansion: they made us pay this dearly. Utterly defeated in Africa, their subjects breathing a sigh of relief as the Teuton yoke was finally lifted, we were nevertheless forced to concede to Germany much of our colonies as part of the conditions of the 1919 Armistice. We had hoped that this would be a temporary measure, that renegotiations could help us get more favorable terms: the revolution swiftly ended those hopes. Exiled to Algeria, we could only watch in horror as the Germans annexed our possessions and those of Belgium, then taking over the colonies of our British allies when they too fell to socialism. The Kaiserreich created a monster, an incomprehensible, behemothic patchwork of previous administrations and renegotiated treaties stretching from Abidjan to Dar es Salaam.\n\nBut we have finally been vindicated. The Kaiser having appointed his protégé von Göring as head of the chimeric \"Deutsch-Mittelafrika\", the overambitious Flying Ogre only managed to catastrophically lead the colonies: under the crushing weight of his incompetence, the fragile construct collapsed. Much of Africa is now in a state that could only be described as anarchic, as European colonists struggle for dominance or for survival, depending on their location. Some within our administration argue that this is a perfect time to march south and reconquer what is ours, but it is simply too early: the Germans still claim that the situation will soon be under control, and we cannot afford to antagonise them before the mainland is reconquered. We will bide our time, observing and contacting our former native allies: perhaps sooner rather than later they will come back under our influence."

The King promptly accepted, and his court cheered.\n\nThis seemingly spontaneous display of royal power was however the result of weeks of negotiations between French representatives and King Agoli-Agbo. With the collapse of German African order, many native leaders have suddenly been thrust into positions of actual leadership for the first time in decades: some, like Agoli-Agbo, have managed to somewhat reassert their traditional authorities over their people. However Dahomey is still in disarray: German remnants still lurk and the King simply lacks the resources to truly reestablish order over the territory of the whole former colony, particularly over the northern peoples such as the fierce Bariba and their wassangari horsemen, vastly different from his own Fon people. As such, Agoli-Agbo needed allies: as his former masters, we were his first and perhaps only choice. We must recognise however that he smartly used our tense relationship with Germany in these negotiations: we could not simply march our way down to the Gulf of Guinea as the Kaiser still claims dominion over the region and so we must settle on an unofficial protectorate, surrounding the King with advisors and shoring up his hold on the country with our resources.

Despite the struggles, Paris will always be Paris, undeniably the most beautiful city in the world, the capital of European culture and civilisation, the city of lights: our good ol’ Paname. Finally, we are here, home. It would be impossible to hide the deep and sacred emotion moving all those who had to leave her behind all those years ago and the awe of those who were exiled too young to even remember her. Red flags and other symbols of the revolution were torn down, and an immense parade on the Champs-Élysées took place to honor our armies and those of our allies: untold numbers of Parisians cheered on their liberators, some crying of joy, others simply staying stunned by this realisation of their most dearly held dream. The enemies of France still lurk, but each day high ranking revolutionaries are being brought to justice: it will take time, but first Paris and soon all of France will be cleansed from this filth.

Finally, we are here, home, and France is almost whole. It would be impossible to hide the deep emotion moving all those who had to leave France behind all those years ago and the awe of those who were exiled too young to even remember her.

nfa.526.d:0 "In the heights above Oran stands a citadel built centuries ago by the Spaniards, the fort of Sainte-Croix. Taken over and restored after the conquest of Algeria, the fort was until recently a secondary garrison. However the sleepy citadel has been bustling with activity for the last few months: a school was created there by the regime to educate the future elites of the nation.\n\nUnder the leadership of Lieutenant Pierre Dunoyer de Segonzac, a young and fiery officer, and René de Naurois, a military chaplain beloved by his men, the National School of Cadres of Oran has created an innovative six-months curriculum to shape hundreds of the brightest youths of the nation into leaders worthy of serving France. With strict discipline, exemplary morality, strenuous physical exercise inspired by scoutism and military training, long hours of study and a deep sense of camaraderie, Lieutenant Dunoyer de Segonzac hopes to create a New Man entirely dedicated to national interests. Interestingly the students in their retreat between sea and sky have begun to shape the “spirit” of the School themselves: nicknaming Dunoyer de Segonzac “Old Chief”, though the man is barely thirty, they have styled themselves as a knightly order, with a motto and coat of arms, swearing an oath to France and their comrades. A development embraced by the direction of the School as the romantic image of the school brings ever more volunteers.\n\nHowever, Sainte-Croix’s independence is worrying some within government while others consider the school to be slowly but surely into a personality cult around the “Old Chief”, if not a cult plain and simple given the increasingly mystical Catholic devotion fostered by Padre de Naurois. What should be done?"

nfa.527.d:0 "Persecuted, forbidden from publicly displaying what they held most dear, relentlessly mocked: the faithful, those who quietly resisted despite the open hostility of the Communards are coming out of hiding. For years open expression of the Faith was forbidden, bishops were run out of the country, some churches were seized, homilies were monitored. In the sillage of our victorious armies some dared to join our forces’ open air masses, priests who had gone into hiding reclaimed their parishes, while some still skittish, perhaps fearing a red counter-offensive, only discreetly brought flowers to the few roadside shrines which had managed to escape the purge of religious expression from public space. With the fratricide conflict coming to an end, the once silenced bells rang all over the nation, great  processions were organised to purify towns and villages from the stain left by both atheistic anticlericalism and the orgy of violence, crosses were put back up, long lines formed at the confessional, pews filled up, pilgrimage sites teemed with life as survivors came to bring their thanks to whichever saint they prayed to for protection in battle or as bombs fell indiscriminately: Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal, of Lourdes, of La Salette, Saint Thérèse, Saint Geneviève, Saint Jeanne d’Arc, all had their new devotees. \n\nThe Communards had attempted to stamp out the 'opium of the people': clearly, this was not as successful as they had hoped. Indeed, the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church."

nfa.528.d:0 "After years of careful scientific research, French engineer Louis Réard has finally put the finishing touches on the most important work of his life, possibly radically altering the course of human history: the Damocles. When he invited the press to an exclusive event, rumors swirled until finally he unveiled his work to the world, leaving the journalists stunned for a split second before the fracas of camera flashes drowned out any question they might have. Truth is, they didn’t need any explanation: a simple picture was sufficient, a picture that would be in every newspaper the very next day.\n\nWith a total area of 200 cm2, described as 'small and devastating', named after the now infamous Red project for an atom bomb by the genius inventor who hoped it would create an “explosive commercial and cultural reaction”, the damocles, now the world’s smallest swimsuit, is creating of wave of passion across Europe and beyond. Réard has already received thousands of fan letters, strangely enough mainly from men, and just as many orders, but many are not amused by this new fashion statement. Conservatives, womens’ associations, and even the Church have already condemned the damocles and called on the government to shut down this clear attack on public decency, leading to ever more publicity for the swimsuit."

nfa.530.d:0 "Avignon is a lovely little town in the South of France known for the well-preserved medieval heart of the city, still circled by high walls, where the popes went in exile for some time in the 14th century and built a magnificent gothic palace-fortress, as well as for the Saint-Bénézet bridge, famously partially destroyed and the subject of a centuries old childrens’ song. However, with a lack of funds allocated for the conservation of the Palace of the Popes under Communard rule and some sizable damage occurred during the reconquest, the city has seen better days. \n\nAs such, to gather funds for the reconstruction of the medieval quarter, the city with support from the government has created a week-long art festival, focused primarily on theater, the palace making for a prestigious open-air stage. Expecting the visit of a few locals, the city was instead overwhelmed by the attendance: thousands showed up to see plays such as Shakespeare’s “Richard II” or “The Story of Tobit and Sarah”, a biblical tale by devout Catholic diplomat and poet Paul Claudel. After such a success, the city has vowed to make this festival a yearly event, with all the proceeds going to the conservation and reconstruction efforts. As for the government, they hope to seize the opportunity to foster a rebirth of classical French culture after years of “avant-garde”, bohemian nonsense."

nfa.531.d.default:0 "Plans for the construction of a great mosque in Paris had been drawn up for decades, first sponsored by Ottoman diplomats and by the late 19th century by a “Committee of French Africa” which sought to establish France as a nation friendly to Muslims as part of her colonial ambitions, or out of more genuine islamophilia. The Great War put these plans into motions: what better way to show respect and gratitude to the many Muslim colonial subjects fighting for the Motherland? Approval was given, funding gathered, a prospective emplacement even chosen. But the revolution threw all this out of the window, and though the Communard authorities did honor the memories of the indigènes soldiers who died for France in the “great imperialistic meat grinder”, they were certainly not about to create a place of worship for them. \n\nIn the exile and the reconquest of the Métropole, once again our Muslim subjects showed their bravery and dedication to the Patrie and we would not stand victorious without them. As such, the halted plans for the construction of a Great Mosque of Paris have been expanded, with some advocating for a sizable complex architecturally inspired by the Ez-Zitouna Mosque in Tunis, complete with gardens, a hammam, a madrassa and even a tea house. Though no one is putting into question the need for a great symbolic gesture of thanks, the project is drawing some criticism from secularists and some conservatives alike."

nfa.532.t:0 "The Grand Tour?"
nfa.532.d:0 "The Tour de France was before the exile without contest the most popular sport event of the year, followed by millions on the radio and along the roads of France, as cycle sports fans showed up  to cheer for their idols. The Tour’s precise itinerary was different every year, and having the event pass through one’s town or village was certainly the event of the summer. The revolution did not hamper the enthusiasm of France for the Tour, though the number of foreign participants starkly dropped. Indeed, cycle sports were even encouraged by the Communard authorities as a proletarian alternative to motorsports, much like football was promoted over rugby. Even in exile, our people listened intently to the Tour on the radio, leading to the creation of a rival Tour d’Algérie which did find much success, though it never stopped our people from illegally tuning in to red radio stations to follow the competition.\n\nWith the mainland reconquered however, it is time to organise once again the Tour de France, hopefully bringing, if only briefly, our still deeply divided people together. However, within the committee tasked with determining the itinerary a question arose: should this Tour also pass through Algeria? After all, the Algerian departments are a part of France like any other. Medical experts have warned that this would turn the competition into an almost two-months long affair and that the sweltering heat of the Maghrebi summers could make more than one cyclist collapse, but the symbolic triumph of a unified tour could certainly make this risk worth it."

nfa.533.d:0 "Before the revolution, Rouen was called the “City of a Hundred Spires”, because of its large number of churches. The anti-clerical number however destroyed some of these churches, took them over for secular use, or simply let them fall into disrepair. Now that the war is over and Normandie has been freed, a question arises: should we rebuild this part of Rouen’s history as part of reconstruction efforts? Many of our Catholic citizens believe that the churches should be rebuilt as they were, a way to exorcise the godless past, however this would have a certain cost, especially when the money could be redirected to more urgent causes. Alternatively, we can rebuild some of them while giving them another purpose, like housing concert venues or public libraries. This way, the history of the city would be preserved while making an efficient use of money. Or we could simply tear down the most damaged ones and restore only a few, to make more space for new buildings."

nfa.534.d:0 "The sleepy little village of Vimoutiers in Normandie, whose only claim to fame was its tenuous revendication as the birthplace of the famous Camembert cheese, was heavily damaged in the recent fighting, particularly after retreating Red British troops attempted to create a temporary stronghold. Much like in so many cities and villages across France, it will take years to rebuild. However, one heap of slowly rusting metal is turning into a playground for local children and attracting the curiosity of a few onlookers: a disabled heavy British tank in particularly good shape, once a lynchpin of the local Syndicalist defense, stuck in a ditch right outside Vimoutiers. \n\nOf course, the authorities attempted to seize the tank as part of the country-wide effort to heal the scars of the war, either to scrap it for parts and metal or study it further. But the Vimonastériens refused, even chasing away one cleanup crew: children cried at the thought of losing their playground, while the adults had grown strangely attached to the wreck. Of course the near pristine state of the tank has spurned numerous jokes about the bravery of the British troops but mostly the locals seem fascinated by the object, its newfound peaceful quietness perhaps a symbol of the slow return to normalcy across France. In any case, the local mayor said he intends to turn the tank into a monument. What should be done?"

nfa.535.t:0 "Pontifical Zouaves"
nfa.535.d:0 "Following the meeting of Prince Henri with His Holiness, the Prince has embarked on a campaign to honor the memory of the Pontifical Zouaves, a regiment of pious mostly French volunteers who defended the Papal States until the conquest of Rome by the Kingdom of Italy in 1870. Following the fall of the Eternal City, these volunteers immediately headed to France to fight bravely in the Franco-Prussian War. These devout Catholics, many of them royalists, headed by Baron Athanase de Charette de La Contrie, descendant of a famous leader of the Vendée insurrection, nevertheless set aside their differences with the Republic to fight against the Prussian aggressor. Despite the defeat, they captivated French Catholic imagination for decades: this spirit of devotion to both Faith and Nation is what Prince Henri intends to revive, as the new regime is slowly but surely asserting itself.\n\nFurthermore, with the Papal States on the frontline of the crusade against socialism, it has been decided that the Zouaves would be reformed, welcoming Catholic volunteers from all over Europe. For the occasion, the 1870 banner reading “Sacred Heart of Jesus, Save France” was recreated, blessed by the bishop of Algiers, and gifted by the Prince himself to the assembling unit. They will head to Rome and proudly stand guard on the Tiber, representing the French faithful united as one in their duty to defend the Church."

nfa.536.t:0 "Native Aristocrats"
nfa.536.d:0 "For weeks now, an incongruous and unceasing ballet of indigènes in the most colorful and awe-inspiring costumes has been taking place: an immense tent in the manner of the Bedouins was installed in the royal gardens, lavishly decorated in an eclectic Mauresque style overloaded with royal symbolism. It is there that King Jean in a hybrid, French-Algerian regalia has received hundreds of natives, all in some sort of traditional position of authority. Proud and enigmatic Tuareg chiefs fully clad in their black cheich, westernised Algerian sheikhs conversing in fluent French, the Mossi Mogho Naba, elected bours, or kings of the Wolofs, and noble princes of the various Moorish tribes of Mauritania, among so many others, all accompanied by their escorts. Each one an ally, they have come to be confirmed in their positions and swear loyalty to their Prince, the King of France, many even being awarded French titles of nobility or decorations: one is titled count, the other is awarded the Legion of Honor, another, particularly loyal, was made Peer of the Kingdom.\n\nThis exhausting diplomatic effort was deemed essential to build a stable foundation for our new order in Africa. After all, these traditional elites of their peoples will be called to sit in local assemblies alongside more minor notables, with more authority than they had in decades over their territories, even advising the colonial government in exchange of their undying loyalty. The Republic in her foolish civilising mission had sought to turn the Indigène into a Frenchman. The Monarchy only asks of the Indigène one thing: to serve France, and be ready to fight and die for his King."

nfa.537.d:0 "The island of Malta, though still a British possession, has been under our control since 1926. Deeply Catholic, the people of Malta were not particularly troubled by the rise of the Action Française and the restoration of the monarchy, though we were keen to manage their sensibilities in the immediate aftermath of the coup de force: this is after all merely a temporary occupation and upsetting the Maltese status quo would mean upsetting our allies. \n\nHowever, we have been approached by representatives of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta, better known as simply the “Order of Malta”, looking for an agreement with the monarchy. Once the rulers of the island from where they embarked on numerous raids against Barbary pirates, a true fighting force made up of the noblest warriors of Christendom, the Knights were defeated by the armies of the impostor Bonaparte. Malta annexed, its possessions seized, the Order was exiled and dispersed. The Hospitallers instead chose to focus on their original mission, caring for the poor and sick. With one exception: an elite auxiliary military corps, mostly dedicated to medical functions, serving with the Italian army. But united Italy is no more and therein lies the agreement the Knights are offering us. In exchange of rather limited concessions, for example granting extraterritoriality to some locations historically associated with the Order, the Knights are offering to reform their auxiliary force to serve under the French flag, assisting us in our crusade to free the Métropole. Of course this would mean taking liberties with a British colony, something our friends would not appreciate, and the actual benefits to us would largely consist in a propaganda opportunity, though the expertise of the Order is undeniable. What should we do?"

nfa.538.t:0 "A Latin Union?"
nfa.538.d:0 "The question of a possible union or alliance of all peoples of “Latin” culture is very dear to Charles Maurras. A passionate of the Classics, looking back to Rome as the foundation of European civilisation and France as her foremost heir, the practicality of such a project is of little interest to the Master, who extends the definition of “Latin” to include the whole of Southern Europe, much of South America, and even South Germany, Switzerland and Romania, gleefully blurring the line between “Latin” culture and Catholicism. Though the idea has gained some traction in the most devoted Integralist circles, at home and abroad, as Maurras is after all an icon of our ideological brethren worldwide, the dream is highly unlikely to become reality: careful diplomatic overtures on the topic were received with incredulity by even our closest Entente allies. \n\nNevertheless, under his impulse associations promoting the idea have sprung up in most of the nations Maurras dreams to unite in one single, holy purpose: the destruction of Germany. These groups have even had some limited but rather positive effects, fostering good relations between our nations and turning into what could be described as an international think tank of fellow-minded Integralists."
nfa.538.a:0 "An Integralist Internationale, perhaps?"

nfa.539.t:0 "The Impossible Hajj"
nfa.539.d:0 "The Hajj is a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca established by the Prophet Muhammad. Each year untold numbers from all corners of the Ummah undertake this journey to the Hejaz: indeed, this pilgrimage is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, and every faithful with the means to do so is called to visit the holiest of cities at least once. More than a simple trip, this pilgrimage is meant to be a time of spiritual renewal, purification, and equality in front of God for the Mu’min.\n\nAll over the world authorities offer their protection to pilgrims and France is no exception: since 1916, the French government in cooperation with Muslim notables organises the Hajj of many, giving the opportunity for those who could not otherwise afford it to fulfill this holy obligation. Established by the secular Republic, this involvement in religious affairs could seem peculiar. But passing on this opportunity for France to establish herself as an ally of Muslims would be foolish, as this perception is critical to the stability of the empire. \n\nOnce an adventure fraught with danger, whether these be natural or from caravan raids, the voyage is now much more accessible... or so we thought. With the irruption of war in the Mashriq between the Ottomans and their Arab subjects, undertaking the pilgrimage would be incredibly perilous: not only the Hejaz itself is in the midst of deep instability, but the whole of the Levant is teeming with opposing armies, rebel bands and bandits, the distinction between these groups being more than occasionally difficult to find. Tales of determined pilgrims being robbed, accused of espionage or massacred along the way have already reached us, and so our government has decided to not form an official French caravan this year, instead encouraging the faithful to visit local pilgrimage sites."
nfa.539.a:0 "May next year be peaceful!"

nfa.540.t:0 "A Call to Decency"
nfa.540.d:0 "This winter is particularly rough, and all over France the scars of war run deep: many are still without a home, in the streets or in precarious living conditions, crowded in refugee camps. Rationing is still a necessity, and the chaos engendered by the desyndicalistion process is making organising an effective response difficult. Neither private charity efforts by unions, individuals or the Church, nor state intervention is proving enough to alleviate the woes of the most vulnerable among us. To make matters worse, our people are still largely focusing on survival: even those with the means to help simply avert their eyes from the needy.\n\nFrom tragedy might come hope, however. Following the terrible discovery of the frozen bodies of a woman and her infant, still clutching rationing coupons, a Catholic priest  has taken to the radio to call for an “insurrection of Goodness”. Abbé Henri Grouès has long been involved in charitable efforts, even recently founding a shelter baptised “Emmaüs” welcoming the homeless, but he has now thrust himself to national preeminence. This call from a simple priest seems to have sent a shockwave across France: the consciences of the multitude have finally been forced awake. Donations, both monetary and in kind, are piling up, coming from all over the nation and even abroad, and “Abbé Henri” as he is now known is dedicating his entire being to heading relief efforts. Of course, the efforts of a single man could not alleviate the suffering of all Frenchmen, but by his example he has already inspired others to follow in his footsteps: many have flocked to the Abbé, and preparations for the creation of a Emmaüs charity network are already underway.

The biggest of these is the Mossi kingdom, headed by the current Moogo Naaba, Naba Koom II. It holds the legacy of the most powerful kingdom in the region before French colonization, which spread its power far beyond its capital of Ouagadougou to neighbouring kingdoms. However, other kingdoms such as Tenkodogo, Fada N'Gourma, Boussouma or Ouahigouya still exist along with their kings and continue to vie for influence in Haute-Volta. \nIn this context, a dispute recently arose between the Moogo Naaba and the other kingdoms. Indeed, Naba Koom II praised the work of the native ethnologist Antoine Dim Delobsom "The Empire of the Mogho-Naba" (L'empire du Mogho-Naba). The book is a real innovation, as it is the first ethnology book written by a native of the country it studies. However, the book also spreads a view of the country as being almost complied to bow under the Moogo Naaba, feeding and legitimating the still very existent ambitions of Naba Koom II to make the Mossi kingdom the dominant power in Haute-Volta. This display of ambitions didn't sit well with the other kings, wary of the Moogo Naaba playing between the interests of the French colonists and those of the population to assert the power of the Mossi once again. \nRepresentatives of each kingdom came in a delegation to the seat of the colonial governor in Ouagadougou to compell him to take a stand of the matter.

Large groups of defeated workers are returning to work discouraged over the lack of response from our government with regards to their demands for even pay. However, not every striker has returned to work. A significant number have left and are assumed to be working with local resistance groups in the region. We can expect more trouble in the near future from them."
nfa.451.a:0 "Good, but bad"

nfa.453.t:0 "Bedouin raid"
nfa.453.d:0 "Raiding is the way of life for the Bedouin people. Their largely nomadic lifestyle prohibits them from settling down somewhere habitable and farming to provide for themselves. The harsh climate of the Sahara also offers little in the way of life which only reinforces their need to raid our settlements. Recently, a group of villagers from Mauritania have petitioned our aid in defending their settlement against the raiders. Once or twice a year, the Bedouin ride out of the desert, ransack the town, and ride off usually with several grazing animals to take for food."
nfa.453.a:0 "France helps her own"
nfa.453.b:0 "They must be stronger on their own"

nfa.454.t:0 "A Burnt Out Village"
nfa.454.d:0 "One of our armoured car patrols in eastern Mauritania has stumbled across what remains of a smouldering village. The few panicked survivors first tried to hide from our unit but after one of our native soldiers took off his cap and set aside his rifle, one of the survivors managed to get over his fear and tell a horrible story about the camel riders of the east who swarmed in to take prisoners off as slaves. Anyone who resisted did not see much fruit for their labours. Another soldier calls out that he can make out a faint trail moving east but a sandstorm appears to be moving up from the south..."
nfa.454.a:0 "After them!"
nfa.454.b:0 "We'll never make it"

nfa.455.t:0 "Lost in the Sand"
nfa.455.d:0 "While our unit made good time, the sandstorm moved quicker. As soon as it engulfed the patrol, any hope of finding the slavers was lost. The ferocious winds and howling sands made any movement perilous as our vehicles were just as likely to crash into each other as make any forward progress. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, they seem to have gotten away..."
nfa.455.a:0 "An attempt was made"

nfa.456.t:0 "Slave Caravan Captured"
nfa.456.d:0 "The story has reached the headlines across the nation! Our brave soldiers coming across the grisly scene at the village but steeling themselves for a desert chase. Flying across the desert, racing against time as a sandstorm steadily approached their position, the patrol eventually managed to find the caravan as it fled across the desert. Outgunned but not without heart, the tribal raiders fought viciously but our boys prevailed in their righteous fight! One of the raiders was captured alive and divulged the location of the place where he was to meet another raider party before turning in to the Sahara.\n\nAfter seeing to the wounded from the burnt village, our patrol drove north and managed to set up an ambush upon the second caravan. Altogether, over 40 slaves were saved from captivity and have begun to spread the tale of their liberators' bravery in protecting them. This is sure to bring goodwill to our government from the local people."
nfa.456.a:0 "Hail the breakers of chains!"

nfa.458.t:0 "The CGTT Starts a Strike"
nfa.458.d:0 "The Confédération Générale des Travailleurs Tunisiens (General Confederation of the Tunisians Workers) was founded in the 1920's by Mohamed Ali El Hammi, a noted sympathizer of the Syndicalists beyond the sea. We of course quickly put him out at the time and forbade the CGTT, but it didn't stop it from existing underground. The union always was close from the Tunisian nationalists of the Destour party, and the two underground organisations often work together. This time, they worked to foment a strike amongst the Tunis dockers and in several factories in the south of Tunisia and in Tunis. \nIf syndicalist propaganda wasn't already threatening enough, the strikes have also put to the forefront a word of independence for Tunisia. An absurdity of course, but one these workers seem to believe in. In any way, it's going to be the time for a bit of cleaning in the dockers of the port of Tunis, and if the strikers won't disperse themselves, we will have to send the army."
nfa.458.a:0 "'This is the first warning, return to work or we will have to use force...'"

nfa.459.t:0 "Moncef Bey Rumoured To Help Tunisian Nationalists"
nfa.459.d:0 "Our secret police threw a concerning report on the desk of the French general resident in Tunisia. The document tells about known Tunisian nationalists entering the Beylical palace in which the prince Moncef Bey resides. These members of the nationalist Destour party aren't the most important ones - they aren't Habib Bourguiba or Abdelaziz Thaalbi - but most of them are suspected of treason. They come in and leave the palace discreetly and transporting nothing but there is no doubt the Bey is transmitting them important pieces of information. Moncef Bey is the son of one of the previous honourary monarch of the protectorate of Tunisia, Naceur Bey, and is the grand-nephew of the current ruling Bey, Ahmed II. He has always been remarked for his opposition to the French regime and he doesn't hide too much his likening for the Tunisian nationalists.\n\nThe situation is particularly concerning considering Moncef is the next on the line of succession to the statute of Bey after Ahmed II. Whatever he is actually doing to help these terrorists, an opponent can't be tolerated this close to power. With our important military presence, an intervention to 'secure' the Bey shouldn't meet a lot of resistance."
nfa.459.a:0 "We will have to arrest him, we can't take any risk"
nfa.459.b:0 "Let him free, but let's make sure he never ever accesses the throne"

nfa.460.t:0 "Terrorist Attack on the a Tunisian Railway!"
nfa.460.d:0 "'Kaboom!' resonating as if the Communards had just bombed the city, the detonation woke up a lot of inhabitants of the suburbs of the city. Terrorists had planted a bomb on the railway line passing by to Tunis. This line is instrumental to the supply of the region and even though the reparation won't take too long, the message sent stays clear: in case of war the terrorists could cut our supply lines with a simple explosion."
nfa.460.a:0 "Damn them!"

nfa.461.t:0 "Nationalist Leaflets in Tunis"
nfa.461.d:0 "'We won't fight for the Frenchmen! Tunisians only fight for themselves!'\n\nThis was one of the sentences written on leaflets found everywhere in the popular districts of Tunis. It seems that the underground nationalist Destour party has once again swarmed workplaces and markets with their harmful propaganda. We will remove these leaflets as usual and as soon as possible to prevent these ideas of spreading more."
nfa.461.a:0 "And we will make a new pile of ash"

nfa.463.t:0 "The North African Star - A Rousing Speech!"
nfa.463.d:0 "A small crowd started to gather on a square of Algiers at 6:00PM this evening. After only 20 minutes the crowd, visibly getting larger by the minute, was already spreading to all of the small streets around the square accompanied by a tumultuous clamour. At the center of the gathering was a young Algerian militant. Even if only in his 20's, he had a rarely seen eloquence, captivating the crowd around him and even the furthest observants were captivated by his gesture and his visible conviction. He declared himself to be a part of the 'Etoile Nord Africaine' (the North African Star), a nationalist Algerian party with syndicalist tendencies, founded in Paris in 1926 by Messali Hadj. The militant was here on this square spreading the words of the party, defined largely by the leaders and intellectuals of the party still in Paris but spreading more and more to Algeria itself. The ENA advocates for two of the worst possible ideas: Syndicalism and Algerian Nationalism, the party aims to create an Independent Socialist Republic in Algeria, akin to the Commune of France, and oust the French off this land. \nThe police took its time to arrive, allowing the speaker to talk for 30 minutes and probably convince some spectators before escaping in the city when the agents finally came to disperse the crowd. This incident can't be ignored, and can't be taken lightly. It is representative of the strategy of the ENA to spread its ideas and supplies to a talented younger generation of militants in Algeria for them to start the fight for independence in Africa with support from the French Commune. While their attempted struggle is far from being over, it isn't a reason to be lenient. We must take care to not let any comparable event happen again."
nfa.463.a:0 "The speech wasn't well-written anyway"

nfa.464.t:0 "A Street Fight Between Algerian Nationalists"
nfa.464.d:0 "Early last night, violence suddenly arose in streets of Constantine. The police report stated that some militants of the Action Algérienne party quite randomly encountered members of the underground ENA while they were seated at a small restaurant. The details of the start of the fight are then unclear but all versions agree to say the street turned into utter chaos in a few minutes while members of the two parties fought, threw chairs, tables, and any projectile they could find all while insulting each other in French and Arabic. The fight finally stopped when rumours were heard of coming police.\n\nThis fight of a minor importance reveals the increasing tensions between the two main Algerian nationalist parties. The ENA is a syndicalist party, founded in Paris by Messali Hadj, forbidden in Algeria and radically opposed to the current French rule. The Action Algérienne however is legal and its leader, Fehrat Abbas believes in assimilationism into a Greater France and calls for a greater traditional autonomy. The Action Algérienne is based on the ideas of the Action Française, adapting integralism to an Algerian context.\n\nIn the end, whatever the actual differences are, the good news is that they all hate each other."
nfa.464.a:0 "Ha, at least they fight amongst themselves"

nfa.465.t:0 "A Shipment From the Commune Captured"
nfa.465.d:0 "Our police have worked well. They were on the beach at the exact moment the small discreet boat coming from Spain was supposed to land in Algeria. In the boat: Weapons, supplies, along with nationalist and syndicalist books, all sent from the Commune and smuggled through Spain. We know the Communards have been supplying the Algerian resistance for years, sending whatever helps the cause by whatever means they can. However our police have made it clear today with this arrest that smuggling will not be tolerated, we can congratulate them for their effort to keep the country united."
nfa.465.a:0 "As if we don't have enough problems already"

nfa.466.t:0 "Nationalist Algerian Books Seized!"
nfa.466.d:0 "The stash was well hidden, in the basement of a building in a narrow street of a European city of Algeria. Opening the door of the basement lead to the sight of a full stock of nationalist literature, most of it outrageously anti-French, and all of it strictly forbidden. All of the books have been seized by the police, to not let them badly influence anyone again, and thetwo Algerians present at the time of the intervention were arrested for treason.\nFurther inquiry has established that the basement belonged to a young pied-noir living in the district and sympathetic to the nationalist cause, who was consequently arrested too. Those pieds-noirs betraying their own country are a real thorn in our feet, as they have to be judged by French law and defended accordingly. They can also use their privileges to easily build a web of pieds-noirs militants across cities and rent places like the one we just raided to organise. But it is also a cultural disappointment: How bad is the education system for this youth to turn out as treasonous as they are?"
nfa.466.a:0 "We can't even trust our own compatriots anymore"

nfa.468.t:0 "Miners' Strike in Senegal!"
nfa.468.d:0 "The colony of Senegal, the most 'civilized' of all West African ones, and home to the port of Dakar, is usually calm. Tensions are exceptionally low between the population and the colonial government. This is why the announce of a miners' strike went as a shock for the colonial authorities. This morning, the workers of an iron mine refused to go to work and stayed in front of the mine. They claimed better conditions of life and better wages, taking the example of the richness of the colored bourgeoisie in Dakar to legitimize their claims. Fortunately for us, their strike wasn't followed in other mines of the country and, after a single day, the army was sent in to take care of the strikers. Let's hope this isolated incident stays... isolated."
nfa.468.a:0 "Now get back to work!"

nfa.469.t:0 "Resentment Spreads To The Lower Classes Of Senegal" 
nfa.469.d:0 "Senegal is very clearly our most economically dynamic colony in West Africa. The large port of Dakar is supplied with mining resources from the Senegalese countryside and with other goods coming from all of West Africa by railway. This rich export economy relies however on a deep divide between the merchant bourgeoisie in the cities, composed of Frenchmen but also of Black 'évolués' (evoluted) with the French citizenship, and a vast working class, the most visible example of it being the dockers of Dakar and the miners. In reality the lower classes mostly work under a regime of forced labour called by the colonial authorities, most notably to build infrastructure.\nThe Senegalese society is thus very stratified, and this is something the lower classes seem to be starting to realise. Murmurs of jealousy and questioning of the system have spread to the Senegalese working class. 'Why are the ones in Dakar so rich yet we struggle to live correctly?' \nIf Senegal is still far from being prone to revolt, a few strikes have already been put down in the last years and this situation needs to be kept to scrutiny."
nfa.469.a:0 "Well let's hope all of that doesn't breed syndicalism"

nfa.470.t:0 "'Evolués' Support the Idea of Independence"
nfa.470.d:0 "Our source about this issue is a French member of the colonial administration in Dakar, invited by friends to a mondane dinner in which rich French and Black 'évolués' (evoluted) merchants sat together. The administrator expected a friendly atmosphere, after all the 'évolués' have the French citizenship and hold a lot of privileges compared to their black lower class counterparts, suffering under the Code de l'Indigénat. His surprise was thus big when he heard a group of 'évolués' talk about how could Senegal organise itself after an independence. The discussion was unbelievable, the 'évolués' were considering a local rule of Senegal and claimed to not be particularly concerned by the French cause! The administrator thus rightfully decided to report back what he saw to the nearest department of the secret services.\n\nFurther investigation has shown this isn't an isolated case. It seems the 'évolués' were fed French political culture so much that they don't accept what they consider tyranny anymore. Most of them seem to prefer a local Senegalese republican rule rather than to obey Frenchmen and fight their wars. It is believed the Commune also acts actively by smuggling nationalist books to this cultured elite in Dakar... The lesson of the story anyway, is that some of the 'évolués' can unbelievably come back to bite the hand that fed them."
nfa.470.a:0 "This type of thinking doesn't fit a presumably evoluted person"

nfa.476.t:0 "The Prophet of Iriba"
nfa.476.d:0 "In Iriba, a small city in Chad, a man started calling himself a new prophet. First he encouraged the locals to kill their cattle to prevent them from transforming into lions, panthers and vultures. Then he told them that they had to stop paying their taxes and throw away their French money. Finally, he announced that White people were leaving the country: the governor of the nearby city of Biltine had already been driven out by natives, and that it was their duty to kill all Whites left to be able to finally live free. To help them fulfill this mission from Allah, the dead would even come back to life and swarm the French garrisons. Not that they had anything to fear: according to the “prophet”, the guns of the Frenchmen now only fired water.\n\n Few were truly convinced, but the brewing resentment of the peoples of Chad only needed the tiniest spark: a small insurgency broke out under the leadership of the madman, a returning patrol was swarmed and massacred and soon the local garrison was under siege. Order was quickly restored and the madman publicly executed, but the whole strange affair is a warning: the situation far from Algiers is more than volatile."
nfa.476.a:0 "At least now they know our guns still fire bullets."

nfa.477.t:0 "Clash Against the Tuaregs"
nfa.477.d:0 "The war led against the Tuaregs of Niger during the 1910's had been successful, but led to other unsuspected problems. The Tuaregs, having being driven off some of the usual roaming lands, had been made to sometimes live in more inhospitable regions. There, unable to rely on cattle farming like they usually do, they had to get more creative. This was the reason for their attack this morning on a Nigerien village, close from the desert but fertile enough to have farms and reserves. A small Tuareg force arrived at dawn to pillage the farms and steal the food reserves, but they didn't anticipate the presence of a small French patrol resting in the village. The French presence wasn't planned, and it only constituted of a few soldiers accompanying a colonial officer, but it was enough to try to stop the Tuaregs. A few shots made one of the horses fall, with a Tuareg tribesman falling on his head. Another Tuareg was shot in the belly, and a French soldier was gravely injured before the force fled and left the village. The French soldiers got to congratulate themselves before leaving to help their wounded friend, the village however had to rebuild on its own."
nfa.477.a:0 "That'll teach you!"

nfa.478.t:0 "Assassination in Chad!"
nfa.478.d:0 "Grave news has arrived to the colonial headquarters of Chad in Abéché. Another French official got attacked this morning and later died in the hospital. These assassinations of Frenchmen are fairly frequent as a sign of protest against the colonial rule which has the record of brutally imposing its decisions in the recently conquered region of Chad. Investigation is always hard in a region where the population isn't cooperative and it is likely we will never find the murderer, as always."
nfa.478.a:0 "At least we can pray for his soul"

nfa.479.t:0 "Attack On a Patrol in Niger"
nfa.479.d:0 "We quite often send patrols across the north of Niger to assure our supremacy in these lands. As we don't have a lot of permanent bases there from where to assert our control we have to resort to such regular patrols. The patrols are usually uneventful but it wasn't the case this time. Our soldiers were suddenly attacked by a full Tuareg force armed and determined, they were hiding behind a relief waiting for the patrol to come closer before they charged with cavalry towards it. The first panicked shots of the patrol did make a few horses fall; however it soon was the French horses that started to fall as another group of Tuaregs hidden in the dunes started shooting from another angle. Completely helpless and surprised, soldiers fell left and right to the bullets and the blades of the Tuaregs before the survivors retreated disorderly. One of the survivors managed to get back to the nearest colonial outpost to tell this story.\n\nThe attack is an outrage but we are quite powerless to punish them unless we send a full blown army to search the desert. We will have to punish people nearer from us, who are probably Tuareg collaborators anyway..."
nfa.479.a:0 "An outrage!"

nfa.600.t:0 "Backed Rebellion in [revolter.GetNameDef]"
nfa.600.d:0 "The natives in [revolter.GetNameDef] have been armed and organised by the occupier of the colony for weeks starting from when our forces were repelled from the region. They have now assembled a strong enough force to declare independence themselves and have also declared open revolt against our rule."
nfa.600.a:0 "Another one? We must get this under control!"

nfa.601.t:0 "[revolter.GetNameDefCap] declares its independence"
nfa.601.d:0 "After kicking out our troops, [revolter.GetNameDef] has declared independence. Should we crush them with our superior forces, or should we cut our losses to focus elsewhere?"
nfa.601.a:0 "They must remain a part of the Empire!"
nfa.601.b:0 "We have more important matters than crushing native rebellions."

NFA_gets_event_revolt:0 "Gets event '§H[?revolter_var.GetNameDefCap] declares its independence§!'."

nfa.614.t:0 "Victory against the French colonists!"
nfa.614.d:0 "When we started our revolt, no one knows what it was going to lead too, some were pessimistic, others more optimistic but everyone was determined to fight for our independence. This determination has now borne its fruit and after this long war, the French colonists had no other choice than to offer us peace and recognise that their rule over our country has ended. This day will be marked forever as the glorious day of our independence."
nfa.614.a:0 "Let us rejoice!"

nfa.623.t:0 "The Collapse of the French Empire"
nfa.623.d:0 "With Algeria occupied, the center of our power in Africa has now fallen to enemy advance. Without our administrative base, it becomes impossible to continue ruling over Africa, our domination has thus de facto ended in our colonial possessions. Everywhere in Africa, our garrisons and administrators are thrown out by emboldened mobs of natives. Our officials and soldiers have to flee to whatever place feels more secure, but soon there won't be any of those anymore. Some Frenchmen already plan to flee to continue the fight, but most of them accept this fact: the war is lost, and we will soon be strangers in our own home.\n\nThe French state in exile is no more."
nfa.623.a:0 "Fin du jeu"

nfa.624.t:0 "The Collapse of the French Empire"
nfa.624.d:0 "We have lost control. The Empire of thousands of square kilometers, spanning several ancient kingdoms and thousands of ecosystems, lakes, savananas and forests we built of ourselves in Africa is no longer in our control. Our army was pushed back by native revolts, revealing themselves way more organised and efficient that we first thought. The first defeat came off as a terrible blow, but then it kept getting downhill, until putting our heartland of Algeria in danger. The situation is truly hopeless. Our only chance to survive more than a few weeks is now to recognise the independance of all of the native states and retreat back to Algeria where we can hope to reorganise and defend our nation. With a bit of luck and an efficient fight against Algerian and internal troublemakers maybe we will be able to stay afoot? Maybe this won't be the end for us... right?"
nfa.624.a:0 "A national disaster"
